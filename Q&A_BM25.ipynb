While global inflation and rate hike\\ndynamics have been at the forefront, there were fresh concerns about the banking sector in the past few months, which\\nalso weighed on the sentiment. Steel prices across key regions were higher in March compared to December with Western\\nmarkets inching up. In the US, prices were over $1,000/t. Prices of key steelmaking materials like coking coal and iron ore\\ncontinued to be volatile on supply dynamics and wavering expectations about Chinese demand. Overall, the spot spreads\\nwitnessed an improvement in the fourth quarter on QoQ basis and were above the FY2023 average levels but continued\\nto be below levels witnessed in FY2022. The economic activity in India continued to improve and apparent steel\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"consumption was up 14% YoY for the fourth quarter and 13% for the financial year. The YoY growth in the financial year\\nis an indicator of prevalent domestic demand and was despite the imbalances created by the levy of export duty earlier in\\nthe year.\\nFor Tata Steel, FY2023 has been a year of strategic progress as we continue to align our portfolio with the India growth\\nstory. India's crude steel production now makes up two – third of the overall production of Tata Steel and should further\\nimprove in the coming years. On an absolute basis, Tata Steel India achieved highest-ever crude steel production of 19.9\\nmillion tons and grew 4% YoY on debottlenecking across sites and ramping up the Neelachal Ispat asset. NINL is currently\\noperating at a run rate of 1 million tons (crude steel plus pig iron) on an annualised basis. India deliveries grew mostly in\\nline with the production to surpass the previous best recorded in FY2022, and domestic deliveries grew 11% YoY with\\nrecord deliveries across segments.\\nMoving to the quarter, our deliveries grew 9% QoQ to 5.15 million tons and saw steady improvement across sectors,\\nparticularly auto and retail. Our net realisations improved by Rs. 1,700 per ton and were better than the guidance of around\\nRs. 1,400 - 1,500 per ton provided during the last earnings call. Sustainability is at the core of our strategy and Tata Steel\\nis committed to net zero by 2045. Our route and pace of decarbonisation across geographies will be calibrated for each\\nlocation based on the local regulatory framework, government support, and willingness of customers to pay for the higher\\ncost green steel. We continue to pursue multiple initiatives to reduce our emissions, including a recently initiated trial for\\ninjecting large quantity of hydrogen into one of our blast furnaces at Jamshedpur, a global first.\\nIn terms of growth, multiple projects are underway across India, and we are steadily progressing towards our aspiration of\\n40 million tons in India. We commissioned PLTCM (Pickling Line and Tandem Cold Mill), which is part of the 2.2 MTPA\\nCold Rolling Mill Complex at Kalinganagar, and Full Hard Cold Rolled Coils are now being produced. This marks the\\nbeginning of an improvement in product mix. The CAL (Continuous Annealing Line) and the CGL (Continuous Galvanizing\\nLine) will be progressively commissioned in the next year or so. In Longs, we are well placed to more than double the\\noperations by FY2030 via multi-location growth and are also focused on product mix enrichment by expansion at our\\ndownstream operations.\\nMoving to Europe, steel deliveries were at 2.1 million tons in the fourth quarter and around 8 million tons for the whole\\nyear. The drop in realisations and ongoing upgradation of the cold mill at IJmuiden weighed on spreads despite moderation\\nin costs. The cold mill upgrade is progressing, and the product mix should improve upon commissioning in the next few\\nmonths. We have also commenced the relining of one of the blast furnaces at IJmuiden in early April, which will be\\ncompleted in the first half of this financial year. I'm also happy to share with you that Tata Steel has been recognized by\\nWorldsteel as Sustainability Champion for the sixth time in a row and by the World Economic Forum as Global Diversity,\\nEquity & Inclusion Lighthouse. Thank you, and over to you, Koushik.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you, Naren. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to all those who have joined in. Let me give you a\\ndeeper sense of the financial performance.\\nOur consolidated revenue stood at Rs. 62,962 crores, while our EBITDA stood at about Rs. 7,225 crores, which translates\\nto a consolidated margin of 11%. At Tata Steel Standalone, EBITDA stood at Rs. 8,089 crores, which translates to an\\nEBITDA per ton of Rs. 16,258. Excluding the FX impact, the EBITDA was higher at Rs. 8,318 crores and was up more\\nthan 75% on QoQ basis. As provided in Slide 28, there was margin expansion during the quarter on account of improved\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'steel realisation and moderation in costs. Within costs, material costs were down, while there was a slight increase in the\\nconversion costs driven by royalty expenses and FX impact on intercompany loans provided over time. Royalty increased\\nby about Rs. 187 crores to Rs. 962 crores due to higher production and notified IBM prices. In terms of FX impact, there\\nwas a loss of Rs. 229 crores versus a gain of Rs. 571 crores in the third quarter. Overall, the EBITDA margin improved\\nfrom 18% in the third quarter to about 24% in the fourth quarter. Further improved profitability was also witnessed at our\\nIndian subsidiaries, including Tata Steel Long Products, which turned EBITDA positive on consolidated basis within 9\\nmonths of acquisition of NINL.\\nAt Tata Steel Europe, the EBITDA loss stood at about £176 million and on a per ton basis and was broadly similar to third\\nquarter. As shown in Slide 13, deliveries were up by about 9% QoQ, and improvement in cost was mostly offset by the\\ndrop in the revenue. During the last earnings call, we had mentioned a drop in revenue per ton of £70 and reduction in\\noverall costs by about £100/t. While the revenue per ton dropped by about £58/t, the overall volumes were lower than\\nanticipated, resulting in absolute revenues being lower than expected.\\nFurther, the cost decreased by £60/t. While the spot prices of energy have dropped sharply, our energy costs did not fall\\nas much as we had hedges in place. You will remember, the hedging for energy cost had helped protect us during the\\nEuropean energy crisis last year - while there was a spike in natural gas and power prices in spot markets, our cost did\\nnot increase as much. Spot prices of natural gas dropped sharply this quarter, but the drop in our costs will take a quarter\\nor two to reflect in the profit and loss account.\\nTaxes for the quarter stood at about Rs. 1,755 crores and decreased QoQ upon lower non-cash deferred tax. You are\\naware that over the previous 15 months, the British Steel Pension Scheme had completed about 3 insurance buyouts of\\nits pension liabilities up to 62% with Legal & General UK. We had previously explained that with each buy-in, a proportion\\nor a portion of the accounting surplus of the pension is utilised to secure the insurance and a non-cash deferred tax charge\\nis recorded in the profit and loss account. We had also guided that we expect this movement to continue till the full derisking is completed. We can confirm that the residual insurance of 38% of liabilities is currently underway and will be\\ncompleted in 1Q of this financial year, subsequent to which the business will be fully de-risked from any pension fund\\nexposure.\\nTata Steel Europe also assessed the potential impact of the economic downturn in Europe on its business outlook. Based\\non the assessment, Tata Steel Netherlands is expected to have adequate liquidity. However, Tata Steel UK is expected\\nto be adversely impacted. Tata Steel UK continues to implement various measures aimed at improving its business\\nperformance and conserving its cash and liquidity. The discussions with the UK government are still ongoing, but it remains\\nuncertain whether adequate support for decarbonisation would be agreed. Given these circumstances, we have taken an\\nimpairment charge of Rs. 11,070 crores in the Tata Steel Standalone books, reflecting investment in the overseas portfolio.\\nMoving to the cash flows, operating cash flow for the quarter stood at about Rs. 8,861 crores versus Rs. 5,020 crores in\\nthe third quarter, and this was primarily driven by better working capital management.\\nMoving to Slide 23, our consolidated revenues for the full year were broadly stable on YoY basis and stood at Rs. 2.4 lakh\\ncrores or $30 billion. Our consolidated EBITDA stood at Rs. 32,698 crores, which translates to a margin of 13%. The\\nstandalone margin was higher at 22%, while Europe was at 5%, reflecting higher input costs due to inflationary pressures\\nand stressed supply chain. Standalone EBITDA stood at about Rs. 28,175 crores for the year and translates to an EBITDA\\nper ton of Rs. 15,467, while TSE EBITDA stood at about £477 million, which translates to an EBITDA per ton of about £58.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'We spent about Rs. 4,396 crores for the quarter and Rs. 14,142 crores for the full year on capex. As Naren mentioned, it\\nwas a year of strategic progress with commissioning of the pellet plant and the PLTCM line at Kalinganagar and NINL\\nramping up to 1 million tons on annualised basis. In FY2024, we will look to deploy about Rs. 16,000 crores in capex, of\\nwhich Rs. 10,000 crores will be in India, largely focused on expediting and accelerating the Kalinganagar project. There\\nare some subsidiaries like Tinplate, which are expanding capacity, and this will also be reflected in that Rs. 16,000 crores.\\nFurther, Blast Furnace 6 reline in IJmuiden in Tata Steel Netherlands will also form a part, and we continue to prioritize\\nthis strategic capex over the next 12 months.\\nThe free cash flow generated for the quarter was Rs. 4,800 crores, and our net debt decreased by about Rs. 3,900 crores\\nduring the quarter and stands at about Rs. 67,810 crores. For the year, we were successful in maintaining our interest\\ncost, despite a 250 basis points increase in the benchmark rate by the RBI, and 475 basis point rate hikes by the Fed. Our\\nfinancial strategy is calibrated to generate returns across the cycle, and our financial metrics remain within the mediumterm targets. Net debt to EBITDA is at 2.07x and Net debt to Equity is at 0.61x. We remain committed to our long-term\\ntarget of deleveraging whenever we generate free cash flow, which is surplus to our needs and capex and balance with\\ngrowth aspirations and move towards a much more healthier balance sheet. We aim to reduce our leverage and resume\\nthe deleveraging journey in FY2024.\\nAs mentioned in the press release, the Board has recommended a dividend of Rs. 3.6 per share. With this, I will end my\\ncomments and open the floor for questions. Thank you so much.\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\nOperator\\nThe first question is from Sumangal Nevatia of Kotak Securities.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nMy first question is on the 5 MTPA Kalinganagar plant. Could you share some specific timeline as to where we are as far\\nas the commissioning is concerned and what sort of volume growth, we can expect in FY2024 and FY2025?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So, Sumangal, basically as you heard from Koushik, we have commissioned the pellet plant and also the Cold Rolling\\nMill without the annealing and the galvanising facilities, which are going to come up over the next 12 to 18 months. In\\nterms of volumes, it will come up in stages. We are adding another Caster in our steel mill shop, which will give us a couple\\nof hundred thousand tons this year because we will better utilise the existing Blast Furnace. But the new blast furnace will\\nnot have any impact on this financial year. It will have some impact in the next financial year because it is expected to\\ncome around March or April. But the full advantage of volumes will come in FY2026. Because you will get some benefit of\\nvolume in FY2025 and most of the 5 million in FY2026. The pellet plant will help us bring down the cost. The Cold Rolling\\nMill will help us add value and the blast furnace will help us add volume.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nUnderstood. That is very clear. Thank you. My second question is on prices, both India and Europe. Could you please\\nguide what we are looking at in terms of 1Q versus the previous quarter and in terms of cost how are the costs moving?\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Especially with Europe, we see that the spreads have improved quite dramatically, so do we expect break-even kind of\\nprofitability in the coming quarters?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nAs far as India is concerned, we are expecting this quarter to be Rs. 1,000-1,200 higher per ton compared to the last\\nquarter. The market is still looking for some direction, so keeping that in mind, this is what we feel. In terms of Europe, it\\nis going to be about £15 per ton higher this quarter over last quarter.\\nI would like to comment a little bit on the cost side. The coal costs are going to be higher this quarter compared to last\\nquarter, both for India and Europe, because we will be consuming what was bought a few months back. The benefits of\\nlower coal price will accrue in 2Q more than 1Q, so coal costs are expected to be at least $10 - $15 higher in both places.\\nIn Europe, as Koushik mentioned, we have not got the benefit yet of gas prices dropping because some of it is the hedges\\nthat we've done in the past, which benefited us last year, hence will not benefit us this year, but will play out over the next\\ntwo quarters. In terms of actual cost versus the spot prices, it will converge maybe in 2Q and 3Q with larger convergence\\nin the latter.\\nThe third comment I want to make is 1Q volumes will be lower than 4Q. I just want you to keep that in mind because in\\nIndia we have had a few shutdowns. In Europe while the production will be lower because one blast furnace is down this\\nquarter, but we will use up the slabs. So, we will not have the cost advantage that you would have when running at full\\ncapacity. The deliveries will be of slabs which were produced last year. So, to that extent it will also reflect a bit of higher\\ncost so while spreads may not increase as much as we would have liked this quarter, they would, pretty much remain at\\nsimilar levels.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nOkay I got it. Just one last question, if I may, on this. On the discussion with the UK government, I heard the interview\\nwhen you said that there is not much progress. I just want to understand when is the plant reaching the end of life and\\nwhat is our strategy? I mean do we shut the plant if we are not satisfied with the support and what timeline are we looking\\nat towards the final decision because we have been hearing about this negotiation for quite some time now. Could you\\nguide a specific time plan, sir?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nThere are two types of assets. The downstream assets are fine. It is more the upstream assets which are reaching the\\nend of life and those assets are reaching the end of life in the next 12 to 24 months. Whenever we feel it is unsafe to run\\nthe operation in discussion with all the stakeholders, we will have to take that call. This is assuming nothing comes out of\\nany of these discussions or nothing close to what we want comes out of any of these discussions. In some sense we'll\\nhave to take a call within the next 12 to 24 months on the heavy end if there's no support from the government.\\nOperator\\nThe next question from Prashanth Kota of Emkay Global.\\nPrashanth Kota, Emkay Global:\\nCongratulations for the good set of numbers on the India front. So, my question is regarding the European operations. It's\\nbeen 15 years, we've done all the hard work, we've shown integrity, commitment, and compassion. Now we are in a\\nsituation where in the UK there is an end-of-life situation and in the Netherlands, the upcoming relining.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"So eventually, we will need government help in both countries. The government will calibrate their help such that even if\\nwe are making good margins, we never make any free cash flow at all, maybe for the next 20 - 25 quarters. So, in this\\nsituation, is it not a good idea to say quits?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, Prashanth, a couple of comments. Firstly, we need to separate the Netherlands and the UK businesses because they\\nare very differently positioned. The Dutch business has traditionally been one of the strongest steel businesses in Europe\\nwhich may not have been so visible because it's always been under Tata Steel Europe. Just to give you a sense, in the\\nlast 15 years the Dutch business has not had to seek any support from India and has been able to take care of its own\\nneeds. We expect it to continue to do so. Even the year which has gone by is an EBITDA positive year, a cash positive\\nyear but obviously not in all quarters. Because of the relining, we have a challenging quarter or two but fundamentally, the\\nbusiness is strong. Even if we were to transition, yes, we need support from the government but also the Dutch business\\ngenerates its own free cash flows, unlike the UK business. So, government support is important, but also because other\\ngovernments are supporting other steel companies, so we also want to make sure there is as close to a level playing field\\nas possible.\\nSo for those reasons, we will seek support from the government but it's not like it is in the UK where the cash flows of the\\nbusiness don't support the transition, and investment [inaudible]. So there the call is, in some sense, more urgent, and we\\nwill have to discuss with all of the stakeholders, including the unions and everybody else and we will take the right call at\\nthe right time. Koushik, I don't know if you want to add anything to my response here.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo, that's fine. I think what you have summarised is the most relevant. These are two different businesses, which will have\\ntwo different paths. As Naren mentioned, he is actually giving a timeline of 12 to 24 months. I am sure we will come back\\nto you when the time comes and talk about our plans in detail.\\nPrashanth Kota, Emkay Global:\\nSure, sir. The second question is regarding, given where the coking coal costs are, can we expect some more working\\ncapital release in the coming quarters?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes, I think we have we have seen significant working capital release in the last quarter. We are watchful about it, but we\\nare taking, not just depending on the price, but also on the efficiency factors on working capital. So, each of the sites, each\\nof the units, and on a consolidated basis we are looking as to how to drive working capital even better, because I think\\nsome of our working capital elements like debtors etc are really at the lowest level.\\nBut given the long supply chain, especially in Europe and elsewhere, we will look at working capital release through the\\nyear. This quarter also, in Netherlands, as they release the slab stocks for the sales, there would be some release. Working\\ncapital is high on the agenda because that is something that can generate internal cash flows for the business.\\nOperator\\nThe next question from Pinakin Parekh of JP Morgan\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Pinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nHello. I just wanted to understand what the cash burn was in Europe in the second half of FY23, between UK and\\nNetherlands. Between the interest payments, capex, and inventory build, what would have been the total cash loss over\\nthere?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo in the UK, we normally have a burn of roughly £100 to £150 million in six months’ time whereas in Netherlands, we are\\nsitting on cash of €600 million. So, there is no cash burn as such from Netherlands. Of course, when there are cycles of\\n[inaudible] energy price increase, they will draw on working capital but otherwise they are sitting on more than half a billion\\neuros of cash.\\nPinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nAnd just to continue, for FY2024, the capex guidance is Rs. 16,000 crores on a consolidated basis. Rs. 10,000 crores of\\nthat is for standalone, so that implies, probably Rs. 6,000 crores for subsidiaries. How much of that would be in Europe?\\nAs a consolidated entity, how much would Europe be able to fund of that capex and how much would be required from\\nIndia?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo, so let me explain. I said Rs. 10,000 crores is Standalone India which is Tata Steel limited, of which about 70% would\\nbe on the Kalinganagar project and 30% will be sustenance and other projects. And, when I say Kalinganagar, I'm also\\nincluding the raw materials which are linked to Kalinganagar. So that's the proportion as far as India is concerned Then I\\nsaid that there are other Indian subsidiaries, which are actually on an expansion mode, be it Tinplate Company, be it\\nMetaliks and others which would be ~Rs. 2,000 crores, and all of them are value accretive.\\nTata Steel Netherlands is going to spend about Rs. 3,000 crores and this will be spent completely on their own. Of Rs.\\n3,000 crores, Rs. 1,100 crores is kind of one – off in the blast furnace reline and the rest of it is actually sustenance,\\nenvironment, and improvement projects. And all of this will be spent by the Netherlands from its own cash. As far as UK\\nis concerned, we are somewhere between, say, Rs. 600 to 800 crores, which is again the critical capex of license to\\noperate, safety, compliance and so on. So, this is broadly the mix as far as the Rs. 16,000 crores is concerned.\\nPinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nThank you and just lastly, on the UK, one of the key investors’ concerns we get is that what kind of shock can a Tata Steel\\nshareholder expect in 12 to 24 months from UK? What are the two extremes in terms of capital support, which would be\\nrequired if either the company goes ahead to fund the new investment, or it has to shut down operations? Is it hundreds\\nof millions of pounds number or is it billions of pounds? It is that uncertainty which is really creating concern. Can you give\\nus some colour over there?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes, surely. So, I think, as Naren mentioned that it is not one bucket. The downstream assets are good assets. The\\ndistribution is an important part of the UK market and there are other value-added products which comes out from\\ndownstream. They are not reaching the end of life; they can certainly continue. When we are looking at the upstream\\nfacilities, I certainly think it is hundreds of millions and not billions, that much of a point I can make. And, secondly, it is\\nalso a question of addressing it in an orderly manner. Therefore, it's not a shock that we would be looking at, at least from\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"a cash flow point of view. But it is how do you orderly address that issue depending on the conversations that happen with\\nvarious stakeholders, and which includes the government, unions, and other stakeholders. We will have to find an\\nalternative where the volumes continue from a downstream point of view. If there is a solution to it, which comes in between,\\nwe will see as to how it must be. But any incremental investment on a new asset will have to be value accretive, it cannot\\nbe one which does not have an investment case.\\nPinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nI understand. That's very clear. Lastly, the company goes back to deleveraging but maybe, I missed the target. Can we\\nexpect the old target of $1 billion a year?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nI mentioned that last year's volatility in the markets etc meant that we had to focus on creating cash flows and also, we did\\nthe Neelachal acquisition which itself was about Rs.11,000 crores and along with some of the downstream ferro - alloys\\nbusiness - all taken together, it was Rs. 12,000 crores. So, we expect to resume deleveraging this year at about Rs. 8,300\\ncrores, or about $1 billion. It may not be equally paced across the year. It will be more during H2. H2 is when we will have\\nthe ability, because just now honestly, our biggest priority is to allocate capital for Tata Steel Kalinganagar, because that\\nis the most value accretive capital deployment that we can have at this point of time.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Satyadeep Jain of Ambit.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit\\nA couple of questions. Firstly, on Europe. I think in the accounts its mentioned that TS Global Holdings is looking to provide\\nletter of comfort on refinancing of UK debt. Given, we are looking at different opportunities and options in the next 12 to\\n24 months, would it be prudent to take on that debt and refinance at TS Global Holdings? What is the thought behind that?\\nAnd tied to that, you mentioned that the downstream assets are in a much better shape. I understand the conversations\\nwith the government whatever the headline figures are, one to two billion pounds, are tied to some support for downstream\\nand upstream. If downstream assets are in good shape, does the company need that support from the government for\\ndownstream also? Or is support for upstream sufficient?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nFundamentally, the letter of comfort is not something new. First of all, all of the debt is reflected in the consolidated balance\\nsheet. So, it's not new debt that we are taking on. And over the last few years as we've been deleveraging, especially in\\nFY2021 and FY2022, we have actually paid off the debt from the overseas subsidiaries and that has been our focus,\\nbecause that's the weaker part of the business from a cash flow point of view, and therefore, those debt has been taken\\nout as much as we could.\\n[inaudible] What we have is the remnant of that debt, which originally was much larger. And this letter of comfort is more\\nfrom a going concern point of view, audit requirements etc. And honestly, we have supported that company for 15 years.\\nSo, this is not going to add any additional burden on Tata Steel, because it's the debt which is already reflected in Tata\\nSteel books. So one shouldn't kind of worry about it, even when we look at the orderly transition, this debt is essentially\\nTata Steel debt.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Second part of it is, you talked about the government support on downstream etc. Actually, what we have asked the\\ngovernment is a full kit, which is upstream, midstream, and downstream. If this has to transit, it has to transit through the\\nEAF route, and that EAF includes steelmaking, it includes the TSCR, hot strip mill, and the downstream will continue. So,\\nit is the upstream and midstream which will then feed into the downstream. And therefore, this £1 to 2 billion is not £1\\nbillion, its more [inaudible]. And that project size was an integrated project. It was not just parts of the project. So, I don't\\nknow if I have been able to clarify, but fundamentally, it's been a new configuration in an integrated manner.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit\\nJust a clarification question on the first part. We do understand that Tata Steel - TS Global Holdings had historically\\nprovided a letter of comfort, refinanced certain debt. But given you are now looking at a situation where there could be a\\nhard decision maybe 12 months to 24 months on the line, would it be prudent to take on the debt at the TS Global Holdings\\nor keep that debt at TSUK and then depending on what that action is, those debt holders can also bear that liability or\\nwhatever that is based on that decision or what's the thought process behind refinancing that debt?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThat's why I stressed upon the point on orderly transition in whichever way we do. These debts are essentially debt out of\\nour relationship banks, and we have taken the debt over many years. And one of the things that Tata Steel and indeed,\\nTata Group doesn't do is to leave the lenders in the lurch. So, I think that is something which is fundamental. How do you\\nminimise the exposure by pairing of the debt or pairing of the liabilities that you have, which is what we're working on at\\nthis point of time. But I think it would be unfair for lenders to kind of bear this as a part of it. And therefore, we are typically\\nprincipally always in the zone where we honour the stakeholders who've provided capital.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit\\nFair enough. So, second question on the capex, of the Rs. 10,000 crores you're looking at KPO-2 say Rs. 7,000 crores.\\nHow much has already been spent on KPO-2 in the last maybe 2 odd years and what is the budgeted amount you're\\nlooking at in FY24? Is there any capital cost inflation compared to initial estimates or is it largely in line? There's a lot of\\ncapacity coming online in flat steel in the next 2 years. And given Europe is also looking at Carbon Border Adjustment Tax,\\nwhere do you think the outlet for all that capacity for flat steel could be, which markets would you be looking at for that\\nproduct?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI'll answer the second part and Koushik can address the first part on how much we spent so far on Kalinganagar. So, if\\nyou look at Kalinganagar 5 MTPA expansion, there is a 2.2 MTPA cold rolling mill coming with it. So, we will go through a\\ntime when we'll have less HR than we've had because most of the HR will get converted into cold roll. And we think the\\ncold rolled market will continue to be strong because of auto demand and many other CR applications. So, the incremental\\nHR that we will sell even after the expansion is not significant.\\nSecondly, we've always sold 85% of what we produce or often 90% of what we produce in the domestic market. And if the\\ndomestic market is growing at 7 million tons or 8 million tons a year, then again, this incremental volume that we add, we\\ndon't see much of a problem. I know others are also adding capacity, but I think we are quite confident about our reach\\nand equity and relationships and product pipeline, etc. So, I don't see a volume pressure. Exports will always be exercised\\nmore as a strategic option for us at 10% to 15%, but balance should not be a problem for us to sell in the domestic market.\\nYes, Koushik?\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. In the last few years, we have spent about Rs. 17,000 crores on the Kalinganagar expansion, of which about Rs.\\n6,500 crores were in the last financial year. So, we will do similar numbers in this financial year. And the project is broadly\\nin line. We had slowed down the project for a year or two, but other than that, it's in line.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Alok Deora of Motilal Oswal.\\nAlok Deora, Motilal Oswal:\\nYes. Just had a couple of questions. First is, on coking coal, what was our consumption cost for the quarter? And how do\\nwe see that? I think you mentioned about $10 higher for the first quarter, but with the current pricing at around or below\\n$250/t, what is the benefit we're looking at in the second quarter?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So Alok, for coking coal, if I look at it from an India point of view for fourth quarter, it was around $267/t, I think on\\nconsumption basis, and now it will be at around $277/t. These are FOB prices, so you need to add the freight. We are\\nseeing $10/t increase in 1Q, but if you look at the purchase, we are buying on average so far this quarter at about $25/t\\nless than what we bought last quarter. So that will certainly accrue, and if the coal prices keep softening, then, of course,\\nit will accrue more. I think minimum of $25/t drop for next quarter, and hopefully more, if the coal price continues to stay\\nsoft. This is for India. And for Europe, it's about $7/t higher for this quarter compared to last quarter and purchasing is at\\nabout $35/t lower than last quarter so far.\\nAlok Deora, Motilal Oswal:\\nSure. Also, if you could just indicate, we have seen pretty sharp correction in global steel prices across several geographies\\nin the last couple of weeks. What's the sense you're getting and how do you see the price shaping up in near to medium\\nterm? We have seen pretty sharp cuts across the board, be it iron ore, coking coal, steel. So, I mean, just your thoughts\\non that would be helpful?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So obviously, a lot depends on what's happening in China. I think if I look at the last few months after China removed\\nits restrictions in December, there was a lot of optimism, and everyone thought the Chinese economy is going to take off\\nand this reflected in steel prices and everything else. But I think few things have happened since then. One is, of course,\\nChina is expected to grow at 5% plus. But China is shifting more and more to consumption-led growth, and which need\\nnot be as steel intensive as the traditional investment-led growth that China had.\\nSecond point is, as Chinese industry, steel industry particularly ramped up in anticipation of growing demand, they were\\nalmost producing at the highest level. If I remember right, they produced 96 million tons or something in March and\\nexported, and hence they also exported 8 million tons, which is higher than what they've done for a long time, which had\\nan impact on the global sentiment because suddenly an extra 2 million tonnes of steel coming out of China at a point in\\ntime when the rest of the world was still a bit fragile didn't help the sentiment.\\nThe coal prices kept dropping, because, firstly, I think China has also developed other sources for coal in the absence of\\nbuying coal from Australia. So, it's not necessary that they need to buy all the coal that they used to buy earlier from\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Australia. So, we've seen coal prices soften a bit. And when coal and iron ore dropped and this happened in China, steel\\nprices dropped because the margins were reasonably good. But now I think where we are currently, there's not much\\nmargin for the steel companies in China. So, I don't expect this level of exports or prices continuing to drop at these kind\\nof coal prices. If coal prices go below $200/t, that's a different matter. Globally, of course, input costs are settling in, like\\nwe said, gas prices in Europe, energy, electricity prices, but we also feel that as some of those prices dropped, some of\\nthe user industries who were suffering in Europe because of very high energy prices will have a slightly better situation.\\nI mean, so while overall, yes, there is still some fragility, but we feel that this year should end up better than last year for\\nus because overall, we don't see the volatility that we saw last year when coal prices went to $650 and then dropped and\\nsteel prices went to $800, $900, and then dropped. It's a little bit more within the normal band of $500 to $700/t that is\\nfluctuating.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Vishnu Kumar of Avendus Spark.\\nVishnu Kumar, Avendus Spark Capital\\nYes. This is Vishnu from Spark, sir. I just wanted to understand what the effective production would be this year considering\\nthe annualised activities.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. FY2024 will be 1.5 million tons higher than FY2023 on a consolidated basis.\\nVishnu Kumar, Avendus Spark Capital\\nSpecifically for Europe, given that we will be taking some shutdown for this maintenance?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So, I'm talking of deliveries. While we had a production shutdown in Europe, last year, we produced more and sold\\nless because some of what we produced were slabs which we stocked up. This year in Europe, particularly in Netherlands,\\nwe will produce less obviously because the blast furnace will be down for 4 months, but we will sell more than we produce\\nbecause we'll roll those slabs into hot rolled coils and sell. This will release working capital as well as give us more sales\\nand production. So, when I say 1.5 million, it is sales, not production, and half of that will be in Europe and half of that will\\nbe in India.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Amit Murarka of Axis Capital.\\nAmit Murarka, Axis Capital\\nOn Europe again, we used to maintain that there is not going to be any cash support from India. But now with TS Holdings\\nproviding some support to the TSUK, is it essentially some change in policy or stance?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nAmit, this cash, and this letter of support has been in place for possibly a decade. It is neither a guarantee nor a binding\\nletter of comfort. This is as I said earlier, it is required for audit purposes because when you do the going concern testing,\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"there are various stress tests that are done. And one of the stress tests is that if the company does not have the ability to\\nsupport or refinance the loan that comes due, and these loans are fundamentally working capital loans. So, if that comes\\nup for renewal, then will there be a support from Tata Steel. And that is an intent letter and not a guarantee. Nothing has\\nchanged between what has been given in the last decade versus today. It's more explicit today because that's the part of\\nthe stress test that has been done. There is no change in policy. We focus on the businesses to ensure that they are cash\\nneutral to cash positive. In Netherlands case, the focus is to push them towards being cash positive, which is one of the\\nreasons why I mentioned that they are sitting on €0.5 billion of cash. And in case of U.K., it is essentially working within\\nthe means to be cash neutral. So that is how we look at it. Pending the outcome of the discussions with the government\\nand a more strategic call on the UK upstream, this is the status that has been carried on.\\nAmit Murarka, Axis Capital\\nOkay, understood. I had a question on the India Standalone business from a 4Q perspective. This quarter we have seen\\nquite a sharp drop in our RM cost on a QoQ basis. While coking coal is down a bit, but it still doesn't explain the big drop\\non QoQ basis that we have seen. Could you help better understand that fall?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nOne was royalty I know, that's been the iron ore royalty, which is the re-notified prices of the IBM. But we can explain it\\nand give it to you subsequently.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt's largely that. So, we have the royalties coming just with a lag, and that's why you're seeing some of the [inaudible] in\\nthis quarter.\\nAmit Murarka, Axis Capital\\nAnd could you quantify that, because I guess this will be a bit of a one-off in nature in that sense then?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo, it's not one-off in nature. It goes through the ups and downs. The IBM prices are notified with a lag and then that affects\\nit. So at times, it goes up, at times, it goes down. It is also benchmarked to the international prices but there is a significant\\nlag associated with it. Unless the royalty rates are revised, which is a very different thing, which is what has happened in\\nthe past. The royalty rates have actually gone up significantly in the last few years, but the benchmark rate also moves\\nalong with a lag. So that is what you're seeing at this point of time. Maybe, Samita, you can give the exact number offline.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Ritesh Shah of Investec.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nSir, first question is on ESG. If I go back to September 2021, I think the company had a release stating IJmuiden operations\\nplans to opt for hydrogen based DRI. In current press release, we have indicated about injecting hydrogen into blast\\nfurnace. So just wanted to understand thought process on hydrogen based DRI for Ijmuiden economics, gas versus green\\nhydrogen? And the same thing on what scale are we doing at Jamshedpur operations right now? That's the first question.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Okay. When you look at making steel with a lower carbon footprint, there's going to be a bouquet of solutions and it\\ndepends on the context and the geography and the regulations. So if you look at Europe, the natural progression is coal\\nto gas to hydrogen. And there's a lot of hydrogen infrastructure being built; a lot of work is going on. And so the whole plan\\nin IJmuiden is convert from coal to gas, and then when hydrogen is available, convert from gas to hydrogen. So, which\\nmeans you eventually shut down blast furnaces and build gas based DRI production, where you will substitute the gas\\nwith hydrogen.\\nWhen you look at India, the challenge we have is most of the steel capacity not only for us but for the industry will be in\\nEastern India because that's where the iron ore is. And we don't see too much of availability of gas, at least at the scale at\\nwhich we want, in the near future. It may be 10 – 15 years later, we don't know. Till such time, we cannot just be static and\\nhence we are looking at various other options. So injecting hydrogen into a blast furnace is addressing the problem to\\nsome extent, you can't replace the coal with hydrogen in the blast furnace, you can replace some of what we call the PCI\\nwith the hydrogen and even that needs to be done very carefully That's why the amount of hydrogen we injected was\\nhigher than what anybody else has done, and that's why it's caught a lot of attention globally. So in our E Furnace, which\\nis a 500 – 550 cubic meter blast furnace, injecting hydrogen for about 4 days to 5 days, gives us a lot of data and a lot of\\ninformation which helps us move to the next level of scale. In India, we will keep exploring these options to reduce the\\ncarbon footprint of the blast furnace route. In addition, of course, as you know, we are also setting up a scrap-based\\nrecycling-based unit in Ludhiana, which will be more about recycling and no coal. But Europe, the transition, particularly\\nNetherlands will be in this direction, more replacing the blast furnace.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nSir, on Netherlands, I went through some research. Whatever we have indicated in past, it's contingent on government\\nsupport. There is also a level of confidence that we will have some support from the government, unlike the UK. What\\ngives us comfort? We understand it's one of the best furnaces on carbon intensity.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, there are 2 – 3 things. One is, of course, the conversations from the government indicate that they will be supportive.\\nBut what is the extent of support, we haven't concluded yet. Secondly, our transition to hydrogen is also very important\\nfrom the Dutch government's hydrogen ecosystem point of view, because we will have one of the biggest offtakes of\\nhydrogen if we convert to a hydrogen-based usage. So, when the Dutch government is building infrastructure for hydrogen,\\nwe are a very important part of the plans. Thirdly, the Dutch asset also has always been free cash flow positive unlike the\\nUK. So, the Dutch assets has its own ability to support a lot of the transition. Of course, we need support from the\\ngovernment. But the situation is not as dire as one would have seen in the UK, where the cash flows of the business, don't\\nsupport the transition at all. Here the cash flows of the business can also support the transition.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nSure. I just have one question quickly on P&L and one on balance sheet. This is for Koushik sir. You indicated NR increased\\nby Rs. 1,700/t on sequential basis. If we look at the blended number, if it was simple math, the increase comes at Rs.\\n4,500/t. So how should we look at the gap of Rs. 4,500/t versus Rs. 1,700/t? This is on a per ton basis sequentially.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Samita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Well, Ritesh, I think if you look at income from operations, it's Rs. 3,500/t, but that's the entire income. But we are just\\ntalking about steel NR when we're talking about Rs. 1,700/t.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe income is [inaudible]. Maybe we'll break it up between the NR and the other incomes.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nSure. And sir, last question is what prompted impairments for UK right now? And how should we look at the next testing,\\nwhat will prompt more impairments? We just checked the balance sheet; I think the exposure via loans and investments\\nis upwards of Rs. 20,000 crores. So how should we look at this number going forward?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIn the year-end, as per the accounting standards, there is always a review of the investments across any company. But in\\nour case, we do it either on a 6-month basis or a year-end basis, and that is based on the value-in-use assessment of that\\nunit. And as Naren mentioned that as part of the business (the upstream and the midstream businesses) are coming\\ntowards end of life in some time, we have to moderate the future cash flows, earnings, and costs and so on. And that was\\nthe basis on which the investment, the PPE in UK, had been written off many years back to a very low number compared\\nto its original number in 2016 or 2017.\\nSo what remains is the investment in the standalone books of Tata Steel, and that investment has been calibrated down\\nby about Rs. 1,100 crores in the standalone books. As we move forward, this will get tested again at either quarter end or\\n6 months end. The assumptions will not change much in quarter-to-quarter, but certainly, in a 6-month period, it will be\\nreassessed, and that's the discussions which we have internally along with the auditors. And the outcome of that will have\\nto come about. So, as I said, the PPE numbers are not something which is very significant. It is there, but it has been\\nsignificantly impaired over the last 6 – 7 years. And we've done deep restructuring of the assets also. So, this is something\\nthat will continue to be assessed at every period end.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Kirtan Mehta of BoB Capital\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nCouple of questions from my side. Would you be able to clarify the investment numbers that we have in the books of India\\ntowards UK and Europe? Would it be possible to sort of give us that breakup as well?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nWell, you have to look at the balance sheet when it comes and see the investment numbers. Those investment numbers\\nare largely reflecting Europe. I think that is how we give it. We don't give UK and Europe separately, because it is flowing\\nfrom Tata Steel India into the overseas holding company, which essentially holds these 2 businesses apart from Canada.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nRight. And just one more thing. There has been a mention about the delay in ramp-up of cold mill at IJmuiden. Would you\\nbe able to clarify its capacity and potential contribution to the margin to the Netherlands plant once it comes up?\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nIt's an existing plant which had an upgrade, I think the capacity is about 1.6 million tons. And there were some problems\\npost-upgrade. One of the subcontractors who was involved went bankrupt and so there had to be alternate measures\\ntaken etc. There were some complications because of which the ramp-up post the upgrade did not happen at the speed\\nthat we had wanted.\\nBut now we are working very closely with the main contractor, and we are improving week-on-week. We had to announce\\nforce majeure because that mill was supplying to a lot of auto customers, so we gave them enough notice to plan\\nalternatives. Now I think we are close to a stage where we will withdraw the force majeure because there's lot more\\nstability. It was more a mix impact than a volume impact, because if you didn't produce cold rolled then you sold it as hot\\nrolled. I think the impact, maybe Samita can clarify. I think it was £70 [inaudible] for the quarter or something like that...\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. It was partly reflected in the last quarter and also partly this quarter.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nCorrect. Correct. So that's also part of the reasons why the numbers were not so great for the last 2 quarters, because the\\nproduct mix was worse than what we would have normally done.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nRight, understood. One more question, if I may. In terms of the India business, we recently did around Rs. 16,000/t on the\\nstandalone operations. When we want to look at this number in the sustainable context or more in terms of the average\\nmargin over the cycle, how far we are from the cycle in the margin, and how should we think that margin would change as\\nwe commission the pellet plant as well as the cold roll mill there?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo normally, we look at a long-term margin of around Rs. 14,000 – 15,000/t. When we plan long-term, we look at it because\\nthat's been our numbers, if you look at the worst quarters, not on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis. So it fluctuates.\\nWe've seen Rs. 30,000, and we've seen Rs. 7,000. If you see last year, despite all the challenges, we are still in that range.\\nI'm talking about standalone, not consolidated. So pretty much Rs. 15,000 is close to range, slightly higher than the range.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nRight. And would you be able to add colour on that how this sustainable range of Rs. 15,000 could change with the\\ncommissioning of the pellet plant as well as the cold roll mill?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So obviously the pellet plant and cold rolling mill is impacting - the cold rolling mill is 2 million tons of value-add in a\\n21 million tons mix, and the pellet plant is adding about 6 million tons of pellets. So, pellet plant cost advantage depends\\non the pellet price. If the iron ore price is higher, then the gap is significantly higher. But I would say, typically Rs. 800\\ncrores to Rs. 1,000 crores a year is what you would get benefit of the pellet plant. And the cold rolling mill, again, normally,\\nif you look at HR/CR gap on a long-term basis, you will look at $100/t. Just now it is lower than that. If the gap is lower,\\nthen the benefit is lower. But if you go on a $100/t basis, and plus I think the advantage you will have with this cold rolling\\nmill is it will really be one of the most advanced cold rolling mills in the world. In terms of the kind of product mix, it helps\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"us get into the very high-end auto etc. So, it gives us a high-end of the margin range. Both of these will be value accretive\\nand will help push the EBITDA beyond Rs. 15,000 on a like-to-like basis.\\nOperator\\nWe would now like hand over the conference to Ms. Samita Shah for chat questions. Over to you ma'am.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you, Kinshuk. The first question is on the ramp-up of TSK Phase 2, which I think we have answered. So the other\\nquestion on TSK Phase 2 is how much raw material integration will be there, especially for coking coal and iron ore for this\\n5 million tonne expansion?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nAs far as iron ore is concerned, all the iron ore that we need we will produce ourselves. We are fully integrated, and the\\nexpansion of the iron ore production continues. I think this year, we are around 36 – 38 million tonnes. And we are on track\\nto expand as fast as the need of iron ore is concerned. The goal is not to buy any iron ore or pellets in the market. Coking\\ncoal, we are typically about 15% to 20% coverage, because we can't expand in coal as fast as we can do in iron ore. We\\nare in the middle of an expansion in West Bokaro from the current level of about 6 million tonnes of raw coal to about 10\\nmillion tonnes. 6 million tonnes of raw coal means about 2.5 million tonnes of clean coal. So, taking it up to about 4 – 5\\nmillion tonnes of clean coal is what we are working on. But by this time, our steelmaking capacity would have also grown.\\nSo, 15% to 20% is the range at which we will be in for coal. Rest we are currently importing, and we'll continue to import.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question was on coking coal consumption costs, which I think we have answered. There are a lot of questions\\non Europe and TSUK. What is the rationale for the impairment right now? Can you quantify what is the value of investment\\non the books of Tata Steel? And what will be the volume at Europe after the restructuring that you've talked about? So, I\\nthink the restructuring is what we talked about downstream, but these are some of the questions.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I actually answered that question a little while back, when I mentioned that the impairment is part of the annual exercise\\nas per the accounting standards to look at investments. And this has been done effectively in a manner where the future\\ncash flows and the value-in-use is tested against the carrying value. And depending on how the business performs, there\\nwill be triggers for looking at this potentially every quarter, if not every 6 months.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is how much coking coal do you expect to import for Indian operations in FY2024? And how much of\\nthat will be through quarterly contracts?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, overall, we buy 15 million tonnes of coking coal, both for Europe and India. I would assume, India, if I were to look at\\n-- must be about 10 – 12 million tons, sorry, 8 – 10 million tons. Yes, and how much would be quarterly contracts, Samita,\\ncan you check with Peeyush and …\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

So, it's largely quarterly, but we can come back\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIndex-based.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is a question around funding of UK. And I’ll just club some of the questions together. Given the impairment, how\\nmuch funding do you expect to provide TSUK in FY2024? And how much will your debt increase on funding to U.K. and\\nthe Rs. 16,000 crores capex spend?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the impairment doesn't trigger any funding. Impairment is a non-cash charge of your investment.\\nThere is no cash impact on that. I guided in the beginning that we are looking at starting the deleveraging process in or\\nrather restarting the process in FY2024. It will be done more in H2. We do target about $1 billion to do that, which has\\nbeen our long-term target. And we will look forward to taking as much as cash flows that we can towards deleveraging\\nafter we meet our cash flow requirements on capex etc. and the Rs. 16,000 crore capex is largely borne out of internal\\ngeneration.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nNext question is, if we decide to close the UK business, what would be the one-time closure cost incl. the pension cost?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, the pension is not going to be a cost at all because that's been taken care of. The closure cost or the restructuring\\ncost, I would say, because we would certainly look at the downstream business. But the upstream, we will have to assess\\nthat, and some assessment is being done, as we speak. But it all depends on how the conversations with the government\\nand stakeholders happen, because that's a decision which will happen after consultation with all stakeholders.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on Kalinganagar. Could you share the total capex spent so far and the remaining capex? I think you\\nanswered this, but maybe the remaining.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. I think we said Rs. 17,000 crores has been spent. This year, we will be spending about Rs. 6,500 - 7,000 crores. And\\nthereafter, the numbers will be much smaller, maybe about another Rs. 3,000 crores - 4,000 crores.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on NINL expansion. Could you share the timeline on the finalisation of the 5 million tons NINL\\nexpansion after completion of DFR and getting Board approval?\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nBasically, our focus just now is on ramping it up. Now that we've ramped up, hopefully, in the second half of the year, we're\\nalready doing the work on what should be the configuration, what are the assets. And during this financial year, we will go\\nback to the Tata Steel Board with our proposal for the next expansion, so that we can get started on that soon.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nOkay. The next question is on the working capital and the debt reduction. It says inventory is still high. Given that coking\\ncoal prices have cooled off, how much working capital unlocking is possible in H1? And does the $1 billion debt reduction\\nguidance assume this working capital release?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes, of course. I think the $1 billion debt reduction takes all sources of capital, which is working capital release, earnings\\nand running the business across all geographies more tightly. So, I think it is a confirmation that the working capital release\\nwill contribute to the debt reduction.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on the interest cost. What has helped Tata Steel maintain interest cost in a reasonable range despite\\nthe sharp increase in benchmark rates and despite an increase in your gross debt?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nOne of the things that we have done is using the long-term, short-term arbitrage through the year, which ensured that in\\nspite of the increase in the benchmark rates, we have been able to hold on to it. In the previous years, the significant\\ndeleveraging has been one of the key aspects of ensuring that our interest rates are within control. And now with further\\ndeleveraging targeted during this year and for the years ahead, I think we will ensure that the interest rates are within the\\ncontrol. Our interest coverage is at a healthy 5.2x.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on green hydrogen project. What are the economics and timelines of the pilot injection which you've\\ndone in India. What is the timeline for hydrogen based DRI at TSN? By when do you expect to do this?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo as far as the India experiment is concerned, it is still early stages. Smaller blast furnace, some injection, we will study\\nit, keep scaling it up. But there is a limit to how much hydrogen you can put into a blast furnace. I think whoever is working\\non it is trying to see how much of the PCI that we inject can be substituted with hydrogen. And we see that when we inject\\nhydrogen, there is obviously a net benefit. You can bring down the coke rates by about 10% - 15%. Obviously, the cost of\\nthat hydrogen, the hydrogen that we injected, for instance, in the blast furnace today in Jamshedpur has cost us about\\n$12/kg. But if you bring it to maybe around even $4 - $5, you'll have significant advantage. Of course, if you're looking at\\nusing hydrogen and scale as a reductant to reduce DRI, then you're looking at hydrogen to be made available at around\\n$2/kg or less. And obviously, all this must be green hydrogen if it has to make sense.\\nIn Netherlands, there is a plan which has been submitted to the government. We are in conversation with the government.\\nAnd our plan as proposed to the government was to shut down one of the blast furnaces over the next year, convert it into\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"gas based DRI. So that by 2030, you have one blast furnace down and a gas-based or hydrogen-based DRI line. And by\\n2035, you have the other blast furnace down, so that you become a completely gas or hydrogen based DRI production\\nunit. So, that's the timeline. But once our conversation with the government moves to the next level, we will be able to give\\nmore definite timelines.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere's another question on hydrogen, so I'll just take it right now. It says with regards to the trial of the hydrogen injection\\nat Jamshedpur plant, by when does it look feasible to use hydrogen more widely for Indian operations? And has there\\nbeen any government support to procure hydrogen at a cheaper cost?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nThe answer for the second question is no. But yes, I think this was a big step. Like we said, nobody else has injected too\\nmuch hydrogen into a blast furnace, we did it over 4 – 5 days. So that itself is first in the world kind of thing. Some others\\nhave done it by mixing it with coke oven gas and injecting it, whereas we injected hydrogen itself into the blast furnace.\\nThis is giving us more data. Typically, in process industry when you try out something new, you take it up step-by-step,\\nbecause you want to see the implications of any change that you make in the process, particularly in terms of the energy\\nbalance and the constituents of what was inside a blast furnace. So, we'll do it gradually. But I think it's a big development,\\nand let's see how fast we can accelerate it.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere's a question on the merger of the subsidiaries. When do we expect the merger of Tata Steel Long Products to be\\ncompleted? And can we expect any tax benefits from the merger?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, the merger process is underway with the NCLT hearings, and the first motions started. It will happen progressively for\\neach of the companies. And the purpose of the merger is to drive synergies on all fronts. So we'll see what are the things\\nthat we can draw. Certainly, there are multiple synergies in business case, which is why we are proceeding with the merger.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere's a question on NINL, on the iron ore mines, what is the status? Are these mines running?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes, the mines are running and are feeding the Neelachal plant. I think we are running the mines at an annualized rate of\\n1.5 million tons. Again, as the rest of the plant, it has gone as per plan.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nOne more question on India. This is on the capex spend and the CWIP on the balance sheet. If Rs. 17,500 crores have\\nbeen spent on KPO till date, the CWIP is about Rs. 30,000 crores. So, what accounts for the balance Rs. 12,500 crores\\nof CWIP as on 31st March 2023?\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere are several other projects, including KPO, there are projects relating to the iron ore mines, the infrastructure around\\nit, the augmentation of various capacities. So, it is a large part of those CWIPs there, plus, there are significant amount of\\nsustenance capex, which is an ongoing scheme over 5 years in each of the facilities now, be it Jamshedpur or in\\nKalinganagar or Meramandali and so on. So, the CWIP is, in a steel plant if you do a tracking, which has been growing,\\nthere are multiple projects that continue to grow both from a sustenance improvement perspective as well as from a\\ncapacity growth perspective.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThen there are questions around steel demand internationally, especially given what is happening in China. So I’ll just club\\na couple of questions. Are we seeing any production cuts in China as their demand has not picked up as expected? And\\nwhat is your view on international steel markets this year? Do you see steel prices and demand subdued this year because\\nof slowing economic growth and higher interest rates across the globe?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI think on the first one, what I read was that China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) did a call actually in early May or end\\nApril to ask producers to tone down because they were concerned that if steel prices drop and everyone goes back into\\nzero margin, then the business is not sustainable. So, I think there's already pressure on the Chinese steel producers to\\ncut production to more reflect domestic demand. And I think while exports should go to 8 million tons, if they continue to\\nexport at that level, I'm sure there'll be trade actions which will also follow. I think that is the comment on the Chinese steel\\nside. In terms of globally, yes, on the demand side, a lot depends on what happens in China. India continues to see strong\\ngrowth in demand. Europe, we expect things to slowly get better as energy cost goes up and helps the user industry. And\\nwe also expect that the transition to other energy sources beyond Russia or transition to greener sources also will spur\\nsome investments. In the US, [inaudible] there's a lot of investments happening. So, we do see that as a positive impact.\\nYes, rising interest rates typically are not good for steel demand. But I think some of the actions that I described suggest\\nthat we will have a better year. When I say better year, we saw so much volatility last year, it depends on which quarter\\nyou compare to. One data point I want to share is that steel trade as a percentage of total steel production has been\\ndropping over the years. So that is also positive, because that means it is likely to be less disruptive. I think it has come\\ndown from about 40% of steel production to about 30% of steel production now over the last 10 years. And this is largely\\nto do with Chinese exports being more moderated and a lot more of regionalisation of supply chains and value chains.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nMultiple questions on the steel market in India. Firstly, I think we've said there will be slightly lower volumes in 1Q. Are\\nthere any shutdowns? How do you see demand shaping up in the domestic market, specifically which sectors are you\\nseeing growth? And thirdly, is there an impact of pre-election spend expected on steel demand?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, yes, 1Q every year normally has a lot of shutdowns. That's normally the time when we plan a lot of our shutdowns.\\nWe did have a lot of shutdowns in multiple sites, nothing as big as the one we are having in Netherlands, but few days\\nhere and there. So that's why the volumes of 1Q, as I said, is about I think 400,000 tons less than for 4Q. That is one. In\\nterms of demand, we still see auto is quite strong, commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles are strong. Motorbikes are not\\nback to where it was in 2019 but improving QoQ. Export markets have been a little bit more subdued for two-wheelers.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tractors have been strong. If I look at construction, industrial construction is strong, the pre-engineered building customers\\nhave 4 months, 5 months, 6 months order books. Infrastructure is strong, of course, and that's an area where I expect\\nsome acceleration before the election, so that the government can complete both at the Central and State level. Many of\\nthe projects will have a positive impact on the public. If I look at residential, it's a bit of a mixed bag. And if I look at\\ncommercial, I think it was strong, but, of course, one needs to see the impact of tech on the overall commercial space. But\\ngenerally, the sense we get is all shopping malls and those kinds of commercial spaces are quite strong. So overall, Indian\\ndemand is quite strong. I think the only part of Indian demand, which is a bit fragile is Indian customers, Indian producers\\nwho are dependent on export markets. I'm talking about Indian customers of steel, who may be exporting their products\\nto the global markets. That's the only area where the slowdown across the world may have a larger impact. Yes, I think\\nI've covered it.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Yes. And the third question was if there is any pre-election impact on steel demand?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So, there I said, I believe in the infrastructure side, yes, there's more and more acceleration, there is more and more\\npush to complete projects. So that will certainly happen. So that's right. If you talk to some of our bigger customers, they're\\nfull up in orders, construction companies.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nSome questions again on Europe. So, Koushik, maybe you could sort of talk about it a little more, again, in terms of the\\nimpairment, what is the expectation for the future? How much more do we expect? Are there any triggers? Also, a question\\nin terms of what is the PPE? So, a lot of questions around the impact likely and the Europe exposure.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt's like looking into the future, but I would try to articulate that if and when a decision after consultation with all stakeholders\\ngoing through the due process, we do come to a conclusion on the assets, at that point of time, it will certainly trigger a full\\nreview of the value-in-use of the business because only the downstream will remain, whereas the upstream will not be\\nthere. And therefore, the cash-generating unit will certainly have an impact of how much will be the impairment. It is likely\\nto be more in the standalone because that's the investment carrying value.\\nAs I mentioned a little while back that the consolidated impairment has been taken some years back on the PPE, as well\\nas through the losses that have been over the years. So, the consolidated impact will be lower, the standalone impact will\\nbe higher. And that's when the investment review will reflect on the numbers. These numbers are very hard to predict and\\ntalk about because of the fact that at the time when the impairment actually happens, that's the time when you do the full\\nassessment of the numbers. As I said that we carry the overseas holding in the books of Tata Steel as in the investment\\nnumbers and that largely reflects IJmuiden and UK. In that a large part of it is IJmuiden in Netherlands and some part of it\\nin the UK. Maybe taking a guess, it would be in the region of 65:35 kind of ratio.\\nBut the other thing which I would like to say is any impairment whenever triggered is a non-cash charge and therefore, it\\nwill not have any cash impact. Other than any cost that is taken or undertaken for closure and that's when Pinakin asked\\nwhether this is in hundreds of millions or is in many billions, I said it is in millions. And I think you should take comfort from\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"that. And if that were to happen, then the residual business, the target will certainly be to ensure that it works on a cashfree basis.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nOkay. I think we have time for maybe one audio question, which we will take it before we end the call. Over to you, Kinshuk\\nOperator\\nThank you, ma’am. The next question is from Ashish Jain of Macquarie\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nSo, Koushik, I've just 2 quick questions. Firstly, you made a point that in the second half, UK had a £100 million to £150\\nmillion cash loss. How are you funding those losses today?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt was not a cash loss, it was a cash [inaudible], it was not a loss by itself. So just now it is being funded through the working\\ncapital route mostly because there are more securitisation and more working capital arrangements, which provides the\\ncash flow. It's like a revolving credit, which is what funds them and we stand behind them.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nBut if I can just delve into this stand behind them thing a bit more means, in worst case, this will devolve on Tata Steel\\nIndia? Is that the way to think about it?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nWorst cases, it will devolve on India. One point I just want to mention, there is nothing called European balance sheet,\\nNetherlands balance sheet, India balance sheet, Tinplate balance sheet. There is only one balance sheet, which is Tata\\nSteel balance sheet. So, whatever is reflected in the consolidated debt of Tata Steel is for Tata Steel to service. It depends\\non wherever it is in the world. So, I think this must be clear. That's why I was answering that letter of comfort, it is a\\nconscious decision to carry on till we have an orderly decision. Similarly, the amount that is in the Netherlands balance\\nsheet of €600 million, it is reflected in the total cash. So, it is one balance sheet and one cash flow that drives Tata Steel.\\nWe don't run the business as individual parts. We run it as one balance sheet. And if there are any parts which are\\nchallenging, we deal with it. If it is something strategic to be taken, we deal with it or investment to be done, we deal with\\nit. I think we need to be very clear that it is one balance sheet and anything that is reflected in that balance sheet, Tata\\nSteel is responsible for it.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nRight. Right. And just one clarification on Kalinganagar, did we say we are expecting production sometime in April 2024?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nWe said the new blast furnace, I mean there are different facilities coming up. The blast furnace is expected to come in\\nthe next 12 months.\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Welcome to this call, and thank you\\nfor dialling in. We have with us our CEO & MD, Mr. TV Narendran, and ED & CFO Mr. Koushik Chatterjee to discuss the\\nresults and walk you through any questions you may have. Our presentation which describes the results have been\\nuploaded on our website. Do go through it if you haven’t already. We will take questions in audio as well as chat\\nmode. Before I hand it over to them, I would just like to draw your attention to the safe harbour clause on page 2 of the\\npresentation, which essentially will cover the entire discussion today. Thank you. And over to you, Naren\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nThanks, Samita. Good day everyone. A bit of a narrative on the way we see the situation. The global operating environment\\nhas continued to be volatile during the quarter amidst inflationary pressures, tightening financial conditions, and COVID\\noverhang. Among key economies, the US and EU witnessed a QoQ decline in industrial output, while China’s GDP grew\\nat its slowest pace since 1976. Given this backdrop, global steel prices continued to remain under pressure for most of the\\nquarter and resulted in subdued steel spreads. In EU, the steel spot spread including energy and emission related costs\\nwas close to $200/t. In India, the economic activity remained resilient. However, depressed international prices weighed\\non sentiment.\\nMoving to our performance, Tata Steel India deliveries stood at 4.74 mn tons and were up 7% YoY, primarily driven by\\n11% growth in domestic deliveries. Our domestic deliveries grew at a faster pace than the Indian steel apparent\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"consumption, which was about 8% YoY. This reflects our strong market presence across segments and agile business\\nmodel. Some of the highlights include - Value added segments like oil & gas, infrastructure, solar and retail housing\\ngrowing by about 17% on YoY basis, in part due to the expanding product range and innovative solutions. Tata Tiscon,\\nwhich is largely sold to retail customers, registered best ever quarterly sales. We continue to expand our physical reach\\nvia new dealers and virtual reach through Tata Steel Aashiyana, our eCommerce platform for individual home builders.\\nSales through Tata Steel Aashiyana have consistently grown over 50% in the last two years. Our sales to the MSME sector\\nhave grown 25% to 30% YoY in the last two quarters. We have moved from tracking 6 segments to 80 micro segments,\\nwhich has helped us to understand customers better and enhanced the ability to move material across micro segments\\nbased on demand.\\nLooking ahead, we expect Indian steel prices to move higher based on improved expectations about China demand and\\nsustained government spending on infrastructure in India. The raw material costs are likely to remain range bound. The\\nfourth quarter is also a seasonally a stronger quarter in terms of deliveries, and we are looking to leverage the momentum.\\nWe continue to progress on expanding our capacity across multiple sites in India as we look to grow to 40 mn tons. Volume\\nwise, FY24 should fully reflect the 1 million tons per annum in volumes at NINL while FY25 and FY26, will reflect the 5\\nmillion ton expansion at Kalinganagar and a 0.75 million ton of the electric arc furnace mill in Ludhiana. We are parallelly\\nexpanding our downstream operations at tinplate, wires, and tubes. [inaudible] expansion in tinplate is from 0.38 MTPA to\\n0.68 MTPA. The wire capacity is being expanded from 0.47 to 0.55 MTPA and the tubes capacity from 1.2 MTPA to 1.5\\nMTPA. Separately, phased commissioning of the 6 MTPA pellet plant at Kalinganagar has begun and we should stop\\nbuying pellets from 2QFY24, which will help reduce our costs. We are also looking to commission the PLTCM, which is a\\nPickling Line and Tandem Cold Mill, which is part of the 2.2 MTPA CRM complex during this quarter.\\nOn slide 19, we have provided some details of domestic deliveries across sectors. And over the years, while we have sold\\nmore volumes in automotive, its share has moved to around 15% of our total sales. This is set to rise with the\\ncommissioning of the CRM complex and incremental capacity at Kalinganagar. Similarly, the growth in long products will\\ndrive an increase in the high margin retail housing business for us.\\nMoving to Europe, Steel deliveries stood around 2 mn tons in the third quarter. Though the volumes were higher by 6%\\non QoQ basis, the sharp drop in realisations on subdued demand and elevated costs, including energy, have weighed on\\nsteel spreads. Looking ahead, uncertainty persists about supply-demand fundamentals, despite the recent pickup in the\\nEU prices driven by hopes of a milder and shorter downcycle. Our steel realisations will remain subdued in the fourth\\nquarter, given the lag effect of some of the contracts.\\nWe continue to make progress on our sustainability journey to achieve net zero by 2045 via multiple pathways. We have\\nalready started initiatives such as charging more scrap into our furnaces. Our products like Tiscobuild Green construction\\nblocks and Dhurvi’ gold which has slag as one of the inputs help us achieve solid waste utilisation as well as address\\ncustomer need for eco-friendly solutions.\\nBefore I hand over to Koushik, I'm also happy to share that Tata Steel is the only company in India to be recognized by\\nthe World Economic Forum as a ‘Global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion’ lighthouse and we have also been awarded a\\nGreat Place to Work Certification for the sixth time in a row. Over to you Koushik.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you, Naren. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to all those who have joined in. Let me give you a\\ndeeper sense of the financial performance.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Our consolidated revenues for the quarter stood at Rs. 57,084 crores, while EBITDA stood at Rs. 4,154 crores which\\ntranslates to a margin of about 7%. The standalone EBITDA margin was higher at about 18%. Overall, the profitability was\\naffected by a sharp drop in the realisations and spreads in Europe during the quarter. At Tata Steel standalone, the EBITDA\\nstood at Rs. 5,334 crores, which translates to an EBITDA per ton of about Rs. 11,623. Excluding the forex impact, the\\nEBITDA stood at about Rs. 4,763 crores and was up 15% QoQ. India steel prices remained subdued for most part of the\\nquarter. The fall in prices of long product prices were higher than in flat products due to extended monsoon and the\\nstoppage of construction in Delhi and the NCR region as per the ruling of the National Green Tribunal. However, the raw\\nmaterial prices were also lower as coking coal prices declined by around $82 per ton on consumption basis. Royalty related\\nexpense also declined by about 14% QoQ to Rs. 775 crores. Overall, the drop in costs more than offset the greater-thanexpected decline in net realisation and that has led to margin expansion.\\nAt Tata Steel Europe, the EBITDA loss stood at about £166 million. As Naren mentioned, deliveries were up 6% QoQ, but\\nthere was a sharp drop in realisation with revenue per ton being down by about £159 per ton. The sharp drop in realisations\\nwere in part, due to the higher spot sales and subdued demand given the macro conditions in Europe and high stock of\\ninventories with customers. Costs were higher by about £31 per ton. While the coking coal consumption costs were down\\nby about $95/t QoQ, there was an NRV loss of about £55 million on the slab stocks being carried due to the forthcoming\\nrelining at Tata Steel Netherlands. Energy costs remain broadly stable on QoQ basis. The currency markets have also\\nbeen very volatile, and there has been sharp movement between USDINR and EURINR to name a few. This has led to\\nan FX impact on the intercompany loans provided over time and this has resulted in a forex gain of Rs. 1,427 crores at the\\nconsolidated level.\\nTaxes for the quarter stood at about Rs. 2,905 crores and are fundamentally made of two parts, a) current tax in line with\\nthe profitability in India and b) the non-cash deferred tax charge primarily due to the reduction in the surplus in the British\\nSteel Pension Scheme (BSPS) as part of de-risking. We made further progress during the quarter on de-risking the BSPS\\nand expanded the insurance coverage from 30% to 60%. This buy-in transaction and the actual movement during the\\nquarter have led to the reduction of surplus, but it continues to be material in surplus.\\nAs mentioned in the previous quarter, the surplus reduction results in a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities in the OCI.\\nBut given the large amount of accumulated losses and the deferred tax assets in Tata Steel UK, we have to limit the\\nmovement by recording an offsetting deferred tax expense in the profit and loss account which is why you see a non-tax\\ndeferred charge in the profit and loss. Depending on market conditions, the residual insurance of about 40% liabilities will\\nbe completed in the first half of CY23, and there will be commensurate non-cash deferred tax expenses [inaudible].\\nMoving to cash flow, the operating cash flow for the quarter stood at about Rs. 5,000 crores versus Rs. 1,700 crores in the\\nprevious quarter and primarily was driven by favourable working capital movement. The working capital release was due\\nto reduction in inventory value at Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel India on account of low commodity prices or lower inventory\\nlevels, but this was partly offset by increase in the slab stocks in Tata Steel Netherlands, as I mentioned earlier. As slab\\nstock inventory gets consumed over the next two quarters, we expect working capital release at Tata Steel Netherlands\\nover the relining period, which will be starting in April.\\nWe continue to invest in growth in Kalinganagar and in NINL, taking our capital expenditure to about Rs. 3,632 crores for\\nthe quarter. The nine months capex has been about Rs. 9,746 crores, and we will be targeting to spend around Rs. 3,000\\ncrores in 4Q to ensure that we accelerate the completion of Tata Steel Kalinganagar expansion project. Our net debt has\\nremained broadly stable at about Rs. 71,706 crores, and the liquidity remains strong at over Rs. 15,000 crores. We are\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"not able to deleverage in this particular year due to very high volatility in the earnings and working capital. Our focus is\\nalso on completing the Tata Steel Kalinganagar project. There was acquisition of NINL, which was about Rs. 10,000 crores\\nand the best ever dividends that we paid over Rs. 6,000 crores. Even after this, our net debt to EBITDA is within the longterm target levels of about 2x. Our long-term target for deleveraging continues to be the same. We will continue to\\ndeleverage in FY24, and we will continue to ensure that our target of $1 billion is fulfilled and met during the next year and\\ngoing forward.\\nLooking ahead, the next few quarters are likely to be weaker for TSE as markets continue to be subdued. Realisations for\\nthe fourth quarter are forecast to be weaker and the drop will be higher than the drop expected in the coal and iron ore\\nprices. Furthermore, Tata Steel Netherlands is undertaking the blast furnace relining in 1QFY24. We are working on\\nminimizing the impact of all of these aspects, including working capital and margins. Moreover, there are few asset specific\\nchallenges. Some of the heavy assets in Tata Steel UK are reaching the end of their useful life. Any long-term solution in\\nthe UK also has to address the rising cost of carbon and the local emission reduction goals. The UK government has\\nprovided us a framework of support for the proposed transition of Tata Steel UK to a low carbon configuration. [inaudible]\\nconsists of potential partial capital expenditure grant, policy on electricity pricing, and regulatory intent to ensure a level\\nplaying field for steel manufacturers. We are currently evaluating the offer of support. We are developing investment\\noptions, which will be most capital-efficient, economically viable, bankable, and value accretive. It will be reviewed internally\\nover the next couple of months to determine the way forward. In the interim, we will continue to run Tata Steel UK optimally\\nfor cash with minimal support from Tata Steel India.\\nWith that, I conclude my comments, and we open the floor for questions and answers. Thank you.\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\nOperator\\nThe first question is from Pinakin Parekh of JP Morgan.\\nPinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nThe company had effectively guided to a certain set of numbers for India operations and for the Europe operations. Clearly,\\nthe earnings are far weaker than that. But it seems that the profitability is lower than peers as well. Can you walk us through\\nas to what happened in the India business? In particular, is the cost reduction lower than what we have seen in peers?\\nAnd how will this trend over the coming quarters?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, Pinakin, in terms of cost reduction, I don't know if you can be more specific. But generally, one area where we had a\\nslightly different issue in India is we were ramping up Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL). So, if you look at it on a\\nconsolidated basis, you had the NINL business, which was incurring costs but not yet earning much revenue. That will get\\nsettled during this quarter because the production is coming up to peak and we will be selling. But otherwise, I don't know\\nof any specific area where our costs have trended differently.\\nPinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nSure. Given that in the December quarter, the coking coal cost benefit that was supposed to be there, the margin expansion\\ncould have been higher than what we have seen. So, just trying to understand was there any [inaudible] of contract sales\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"volume issue or whether other than coking coal costs, some of the other expenditure did end up being higher than what\\nwas earlier thought in November.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nNo. When we had met in November, I think the guidance on the realisations were not as pessimistic as it turned out to be.\\nIf you really look at it, as we went into that quarter, we thought the prices would have reached its bottom and will start\\nmoving up or if not move up, will stay stable. But the realisations in 3Q in India have been about Rs. 2,000 less than 2Q.\\nSo, the margin expansion in 3Q was largely supposed to come from the drop in coal consumption cost. The coal\\nconsumption cost was lower by $90/t, which is what we have guided in November. But in terms of what we had expected,\\nwe didn't expect the prices to drop as much as it did. And by the time it did, it was already towards the end of December.\\nAnd secondly, we were also hoping to get relief on export duty earlier than when it came. It came only in the middle of\\nNovember, whereas we have been hoping that it would have come earlier because the steel prices in the domestic markets\\nwere still quite low. We had a pretty good quarter as far as production is concerned. And I think at least in India, we didn't\\nhave issues.\\nPinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nSure. Fair enough. My second question is just going back to NINL, you said that it has been ramping up during this quarter.\\nNow if you look at the medium term ROIC target of 15% on Rs. 12,000 crore investment, it effectively implies a steady\\nstate through-cycle EBITDA of Rs. 2,000 crores from that acquisition. So, when can we see that kind of earnings come\\nthrough from NINL, because clearly, at this point of time, it is a material drag on consolidated earnings?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nBasically, in NINL we were EBITDA negative in the last quarter and that changes obviously because one is we are today\\nproducing at least 50,000 - 60,000 tons a month and we hope to take it to 80,000 tons a month of steel. I'm not talking of\\nhot metal. For hot metal, the blast furnace is already at 80,000 - 90,000 tons a month So, the billet production is there and\\nthey're selling the end product as Tata Tiscon. So, next year, for instance, you will see 1 mn tons of production out of NINL.\\nSo, the return on investment on NINL was also based on the expansion of Neelachal beyond the 1 mn tons, we said the\\nRs. 12,000 crore valuation was not for a 1 mn ton capacity, but both for the opportunity for us to increase the size, because\\nif you look at 1 mn ton capacity, we would have been closer to what we paid for Usha Martin or something like that. What\\nwe paid extra was for the iron ore, which is coming at premium, and we've paid for the land, which is 2,500 acres of land.\\nThat's what we've paid the premium for. So, to monetize that, we obviously need to expand Neelachal to about 4 – 5 mn\\ntons at least, which we will do. We'll go to our Board once we ramp up to 1 mn tons. We are waiting for the 1 mn tons\\noperating rate to be reached before we go and invest capital for expansion in NINL.\\nOperator\\nThe next question from Amit Dixit of ICICI Securities.\\nAmit Dixit, ICICI Securities\\nI have 2 questions. The first 1 is essentially on the non-cash deferred tax payment or provision in the consolidated numbers.\\nIs it possible that theoretically if there is profit in Tata Steel Europe, then this can be offset at a later date? So theoretically,\\nwe can get a lower tax rate? Or is it that the profits must be in Tata Steel UK for the offset there to take place?\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes, Amit, the offset must be in the entity, which is carrying this, which is Tata Steel UK.\\nAmit Dixit, ICICI Securities\\nThe second question relates to the spreads in TSE. Now while in the prepared remarks you have mentioned that the drop\\nin realisation would be higher than the benefits of coking coal and / or iron ore escalation. Now will there be any NRV\\nprovisions in this quarter as well given that prices have moved up in Europe. £55 million was recorded in last quarter, will\\nthere be something in this quarter also? And will we have more EBITDA compression, or will we end up with a number\\nlower than what we have in this quarter on per ton basis.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think to answer that question, first is, we've kind of taken all the NRV that we could estimate. As you know, the NRV\\nis point to point, from the end of the last quarter. So, we had stocked up slabs in the Netherlands in anticipation of the blast\\nfurnace relining. And as the blast furnace relining will take about 120 days, you must have enough stock to do the business\\nand service customers.\\nSo, this stock has been accumulated over the last 6 months. At that point of time, the coal prices were north of $450/t and\\niron ore prices were also high, which is why this NRV testing happened, and the write-down of the NRV mark-to-market is\\nwhat we have taken in this quarter. If the prices don't fall very sharply or significantly from here, I don't see any material\\nNRVs. I can't rule out small changes in NRVs, but nothing material in that nature. In UK and Netherlands, we don’t want\\nto run flat out for cash. And therefore, if that’s the case, then we are also targeting significant stock level reductions, as far\\nas is practical to run the business. And therefore, end March inventory number should look much lower, hence the risk of\\nthe NRV comes down.\\nAmit Dixit, ICICI Securities\\nGreat. One associated question that the annual contracts that are going to be negotiated maybe from CY23, the\\nexpectation is that they would be negotiated at a significantly lower level, given that what we saw in CY22. And the quarterly\\ncontract that possibly [inaudible] will enter in March. would again be at a significantly lower level because at that time\\nRussia/Ukraine war was there. So, do you expect that contracts, monthly contracts or quarterly contracts will be negotiated\\nlower and therefore, we can have overhang of lower realisation extending right into the first six months, let's say in FY24.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, Amit, let me put it this way. The annual contracts that we had for last year, most of them were in excess of €1,000 per\\nton. So, this year, while the annual contracts are at a lower level, depending on which sector, which industry by €100 to\\n€150 or maximum of €200 per ton, but they're still higher than the spot prices. That's one point I wanted to make. Secondly,\\nthe spot prices are going up now. If you've seen in Europe, it's gone up by about €50 per ton. If you look at last quarter\\nand this is an extension of Koushik's answer, the cost of 3Q is higher than the cost of 2Q because of these NRV provisions.\\nSo, despite the coal being $90 per ton cheaper and iron ore being $20 per ton cheaper, our cost was £31 per ton higher\\nin 3Q compared to 2Q only because of this NRV provision.\\nWhen you look at 4Q, we expect that the realisations in Europe will be about £70 per ton lower than 3Q but expect cost to\\nbe at least £100 per ton lower on QoQ basis. So, we see a margin expansion per ton this quarter. Of course, we are still\\nlooking at gas prices and many other moving parts just now, but at least from a margin per ton or EBITDA per ton point of\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"view, hopefully, the worst is behind us as far as 3Q is concerned. Now going forward, the stocks that Koushik said,\\nbasically, we had to build up about 700 kt stock. That will start getting converted into cash. While the blast furnace will be\\ndown, the sales will not be down to the extent of what production is down, and that's what these slab stocks are going to\\ndo. Since NRV correction has been done for the slab stocks, if the spot prices and the steel prices keep going up, we\\nshouldn't have a problem.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Indrajit Agarwal of CLSA.\\nIndrajit Agarwal, CLSA\\nI have 2 questions. First, if you can give us some indication as to what the relining capex would be and how long the\\nshutdown be? And in view of that, what is our cash fixed cost per ton in Europe? So, at what EBITDA levels will it not need\\nsupport from India? That is my first question.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think, the blast furnace shutdown is planned for about 120 days. Regarding cash, [inaudible], but it's a question of\\nalso ordering has also been done over the last one year. So, some part of the cash has already been spent, and there will\\nbe some spend obviously as the relining happens over the period and it is in the ballpark of about €250 million to €275\\nmillion, and some of it has already been spent and some will be spent. And I think if I can put it the reverse way, Tata Steel\\nNetherlands is actually sitting on €600 million of cash, so they don't require any money from India.\\nIndrajit Agarwal, CLSA\\nAnd UK still needs the cash infusion\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo that's why I said that in my comments that we would look at running it for cash. And we will minimize as much as we\\ncan [inaudible]. And including in this quarter, there is almost about Rs. 1,000 crores of working capital release. So, we will\\ncontinue to push that very hard.\\nIndrajit Agarwal, CLSA\\nMy second question is on coking coal. While we understand your fourth quarter guidance, but given the news flows around\\nthe Australia China trade opening up, how do you see coking coal prices trending on 6 to 9-month basis from here?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think coking coal is obviously not as liquid a market as one would like it to be and hence is very vulnerable to be\\nfluctuations. We see coking coal prices between $250 and $350 per ton. Unless there are events like the Russia – Ukraine\\ncrisis, it will fluctuate in that range. There would be some weather event in Australia for which it may spike up or something\\nelse. But we are not seeing coking coal prices drop much below $250 per ton in the short term or medium term because,\\nhonestly, there are not so many investments being made in coking coal because generally coal has seen a bad basket to\\ninvest in. So, this is where the challenge is. But I think this is the range that we can see coking coal prices. Today, it's gone\\nup close to $350 per ton. Your question on China buying coking coal, well, I think one thing which China has done well as\\nthey managed for the last few years without buying Australian coking coal. So, they managed to get the quality they want\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"it out of the facilities that they have. They've also been buying out of Russia. So, I'm not sure it will make such a material\\ndifference as it would have done three, four years ago because they have developed alternate sources over last few years.\\n\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Satyadeep Jain of Ambit Capital.\\n\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit Capital:\\nThank you. A couple of questions on Europe. First on the profitability, I believe a couple of years ago, the company was\\nembarking on a transformation program and that time we thought that at spreads of about €240/t, the company was looking\\nat cash breakeven. Given the current spreads area also about €200/t which are not too far from those levels, the company\\nshould have possibly been at least EBITDA breakeven. Is there something maybe on the UK plants reaching end of life or\\nis there anything else going on that is leading to the deviation from the targeted transformation plan savings. That’s the\\nfirst question.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYeah. So Satyadeep, I think two things. One is, of course, our traditional view of spreads now needs to get corrected for\\nenergy costs and gas costs. Because traditionally, energy and gas were hardly less than 10% of the raw material costs,\\nwhereas it went up last year to almost 40%. So, it played a very material role. Now it is coming back to around 10% to\\n20%. It's at a more reasonable level. So that is one thing that's why what we have traditionally seen is €225 and €250/t\\nspreads. So that's one change. Second point is, if you really split UK and Netherlands, Netherlands business has\\ntraditionally been EBITDA positive, cash positive, for sure, every year and pretty much all quarters. Only last quarter was\\none of those quarters where it was EBITDA negative, but largely because of the NRV provisions that we had to make on\\nthe slab stock, which in itself was unusual situation as a build up to the [inaudible] summer shutdown.\\nUK is where we have a challenge because energy costs have always been higher and have become even higher. We\\nhave some challenges on end of life. So, what happens in the end-of-life situation is the production levels are also not as\\nstable as we would like it to be, and that leads to unplanned outages. So that's something that we are dealing with. So, a\\nlot of the underperformance has been in UK for the last quarter. Netherlands also has not had as good a quarter as they\\nwould normally have. So, we expect in Netherlands, at least, operationally, this quarter was fine, but next quarter, we have\\nthis blast furnace relining after that things should come back to a stable state in Netherlands. The UK situation is slightly\\ndifferent. Cost situation is improving in both these places because industry prices have come back close to pre-Russia\\nUkraine [inaudible] levels. So that's the way we see it. I think Netherlands should continue to be cash positive and EBITDA\\npositive and should not need support from India. UK is what as Koushik said, we will take a call going forward.\\nYou should also keep in mind that Europe is today in a high inflation environment. So, the inflation is much higher than\\nwhat we had thought two, three years back, and that also has an impact on cost. So, even if we have taken out a lot of\\ncosts, some of the costs because of the inflationary pressures have gone up more than we had planned three years back.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit Capital:\\nThe second question is on capex. The $250 million to $275 million for relining, I think I was under impression that this is\\ngoing to be partial relining given the eventual transition to DRI sometime in the future. For a partial reline it seems\\nsomewhat high. And secondly, on the media reports indicate possibly a $1 billion requirement for conversion for UK. If I\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"understand it correctly, the idea is to convert it to a standalone EAF, given the scrap supplies there. The capex required\\nfor this should be, I believe much lower than those media headlines. Is there a thought behind maybe not just looking at a\\nstandalone EAF or possibly exploring other options there?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nOn the relining, it depends on if you're comparing to a relining cost in India, obviously, $275 million looks high. But if you\\ncompared to what relining cost is in Europe, it is comparable. Having said that, this blast furnace is expected to run at least\\ntill 2035, even in our transition plan. So that's why this is being relined for that kind of life. The blast furnace, which will go\\ndown first will be the blast furnace, which is coming up for relining in 2026 or 2027. So, we have two blast furnaces in\\nNetherlands. So, this is being planned to be run until 2035, even in a transition plan.\\nAs far as UK is concerned, the media reports on the numbers are speculative. So, I don't want to comment on that. But\\nhaving said that, the proposal to the government was not just about an EAF, but it was also about the hot strip mill, which\\nis also coming to end of life and some of the other assets, which were important to keep the site sustainable. So that's why\\nthe amount [inaudible] what we would spend typically on an EAF. But given what we've got from the government, we are\\nlooking at what then would be the next best thing. What is the best that we can do with that kind of money that may be\\navailable to us and the policy support that we will get from the government! So, I think this is what we are working out\\nbased on the recent inputs that we had from the government.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Ritesh Shah of Investec.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nA couple of questions sir, first is, can you broadly give us some colour on the assets that we have in Europe. I think in the\\nprior question, you indicated that there are two furnaces in the Netherlands. One, that is due for relining and will be till\\n2035, and the other blast furnace, it has a relining due by 2026. Is that right?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. That's right. 2026 – 2027 around that time\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nSir, how should we understand the same aspect for the UK operations, wherein you indicate there are many assets\\nreaching end of useful life. And if you could please put in perspective what you indicated that the framework that you are\\nengaging with the UK government on practical grant for creating a level playing field. I don't know whether it refers to\\nCBAM or something else. If you could marry both those verticals together, it would be great, sir.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSure. So, in UK., if you look at, so one of the blast furnaces in the UK got relined about 5 – 6 years back, okay, or maybe\\n10 years back in 2012. So, typically, once a blast furnace is relined, it will run for anything from 15 years to 20 years. So,\\nthere is one blast furnace, which can go on for slightly longer. There are many parts in the UK business, where the assets\\nare a bit old and need support. And that's where our proposal to the government was to say that instead of spending capital\\non assets, which anyway don't have a very long-term future, why don't we use that opportunity to transition into a greener\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"process, particularly given that the UK has a lot of scrap, which it is exporting. But the challenge there was the energy cost\\nin the UK even before Ukraine was twice the energy costs in Europe.\\nSo, our ask of the government was at least 50% of the capex that we need to spend should be supported and there should\\nbe policy support on energy cost so that we are not disadvantaged compared to Europe. And thirdly, of course, the policy\\nsupport that the European steel companies are getting in terms of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The ask in\\ngeneral in Europe by steel companies of governments is typically on these principles that at least 50% of the capex that is\\nrequired to be supported as grants because the industry - through its cash flows cannot justify spending out the capex that\\nit needs for this transition. And secondly, Opex support because when you transition from coal to gas and hydrogen, your\\ninput costs are less dependent on steel prices. When you're looking at metallurgical coal, there's a correlation between\\nthe metallurgical coal price and the steel price. But when you're starting to use gas and hydrogen, the correlation is not\\nthere because gas and hydrogen are used for other applications as well. So, the ask of the government is to also say that\\nhow do you protect the industry, if it's changing from one consumable to another, which is move vulnerable to other\\nindustries. The third point, of course, in Europe is about Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. So, the last point is that\\nwe are also saying that there should be a level playing field, not only in terms of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\\nBut if there are some countries in Europe supporting their steel industry with let's say 50% of capex, then the other countries\\nalso need to consider that because otherwise, at the end of the transition, some of the steel companies in Europe will be\\ndisadvantaged compared to somebody else who's got more support from the government. So that has also been asked\\non the principle of support, and this is what has actually been discussed by us and our peers to the multiple governments\\nin the countries that we operate in.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nSir, if I had to conclude on that point, what is the aspirational ROIC? In the presentation, we indicate 15%. So, for\\nstandalone, whatever we do for UK operations, even factoring 50% hypothetically the government does contribute to the\\ncapex. What is the ROIC that we are looking at a corresponding cost of capital? Just trying to make sense of the\\nincremental return.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, on that Ritesh, it’s more linked to the cost of capital. So, what works for in India, for example, our WACC hurdles are\\nmore than 12%. But in Europe, it will be around 9 - 10%. That's the IRR hurdle for approval of capex. But the ROIC that\\nwe are looking for is always at about 15%.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec\\nSure. That's very useful. And I had a couple of questions for India operations. First is, do we see leeway to increase local\\nsteel prices from an import parity mark standpoint. Second is volume guidance, if it's possible for FY25 basis, given I think\\nthe street will start to look at the company on FY25 basis. And third is basically iron ore merchant sales, is there an\\noptionality that the company has over here, if at all, if you could detail any plans on this aspect. Thank you so much.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think steel prices in India are also reflecting the trends in international prices. If you look at prices in Southeast Asia,\\nthey got up $100/t in the last four weeks, and steel prices in India, we expect it to go up by that amount over January,\\nFebruary and certainly by March. So that's something which is mirroring what's happening in the international markets.\\nThe demand in India has been strong. There was in between a few shipments of imports which came from Russia etc. but\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"I don't see import as a big threat just yet. Japan [inaudible] exporting a lot because the yen has gone to 145 and the yen\\nhas also strengthened. So, I think we are in a much better situation today as far as import prices concern than we were\\ntwo, three months back. And I also think, in any case, the steel prices in India, we need to find a better balance than we've\\nseen in the last three, four months. I think that's reflected in the financials of the steel companies over the last two quarters.\\nright? And particularly, if the industry needs to invest for growth, we need better cash flows than we've got in the last two\\nquarters. So that's as far as steel prices are concerned.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think there was a question on volumes. So, Ritesh, as you know, we don't give annual volumes guidance at this time. We\\nwill do that once we finalize our annual plan. So maybe we can just walk him through in broad sense what we expect.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, in terms of volumes next year you will see Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited at 1 million ton. We've not seen much of\\nNeelachal this year because we started the plant within three months of acquiring it, but pretty much the steelmaking\\nstarted in November. And we have today… in fact, yesterday was the highest ever production that Neelachal has ever\\nhad. We produced 3,200 tons of steel yesterday in Neelachal. So that means the going rate is already at the capacity. So\\nthat is the incremental volume, which will come next year. We will also getting some incremental volume out of the\\nKalinganagar. We have a new caster coming that should be up. Kalinganagar today is actually producing at over 300,000\\ntons a month, which is like 3.6 mn ton rate. So, we'll get some additional volumes from the caster. We'll give guidance\\nwhen we do the annual results. There is some debottlenecking which will also get us some volumes. But how much more,\\nwe will guide you in the next call. In two years, we will have the Ludhiana plant also up, which is 0.75 million tons and by\\nthis time the Kalinganagar blast furnace should have also started.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Kirtan Mehta of BoB Capital.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nJust to continue the previous question, you've given some colour on FY24 numbers and to get more on FY25, which is\\nlikely to be the valuation base for the street - could you walk us through the ramp-up sequence of Kalinganagar expansion\\npost expansion? How long would it take to ramp up to full capacity?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo next year, what you will see is, firstly, the pellet plant would have ramped up by the end of the first quarter, which means\\nwe don't need to buy pellets, which means cost savings for Tata Steel. Secondly, the cold rolling mill, not the galvanizing\\nline, but the cold rolling mill will be ready. So, we will have what we call full hot CR (FHCR), which can be sold. So basically,\\nthe hot-rolled coil gets converted into cold roll. So, there's no incremental volume, but there's incremental value which\\ncomes from that. Like I said, if we have the new caster in by the middle of next year, we will get some additional volumes\\nfrom steel mill because today we make more hot metal than the steel mill shops can consume. So, these are the areas\\nwhere you will see the ramp-up.\\nThe blast furnace of Kalinganagar should come up only in FY25, and that's where you will see the ramp up. Typically blast\\nfurnaces ramp up fast unless you have a problem. The hot strip mill and the steel mill shops would also be ready. And\\nonce you have the blast furnace making hot metal, ramping up the steel melt shop, and the hot strip mill is not an issue. If\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"you remember the Kalinganagar Phase 1 ramp-up was one of the fastest for any greenfield site. I think we did it in about\\n16 months, the full ramp-up. So that's typically what it would take. We should keep in mind that it's going to be one of the\\nbiggest blast furnaces in India. So, we will obviously ramp up keeping the complexity of large furnaces in mind.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nThanks for these details. One more question from my side. If you look at the Tata Steel and its subsidiaries, there is spread\\nwhich is opened up to around 12% to 15%, if we take the conversion ratios into account. So, in fact, if we look at it from\\nthis perspective, it would be that market is pricing between 1 to 1.5 years for the merger to conclude. Do you think that's\\na fair estimate by the market? Or do you see the merger progressing a bit faster than that?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, Kirtan, I think we are at a stage where we have done the filing with SEBI and regulators, and we will be looking at\\ngetting their clearances. And since some of them are listed companies, I think a year is the honorary course of business\\nof the NCLT, we should be able to do that. I don't see it in 1.5 years. In Bhushan, we got delayed because of multiple\\nreasons, but these are our subsidiaries for long. So, we are hoping that we can close it before one year.\\nOperator\\nWe would now like hand over the conference to Ms. Samita Shah for chat questions. Over to you ma'am.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you, Kinshuk. I'll start with the questions on India. We have a question on auto. We had said that auto sector is 15%\\nof our volumes. What would be the growth trajectory going forward for the company on an average? And what is our\\ntargeted mix from the auto sector for FY24?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, obviously, our growth in auto will depend largely on the pace at which automotive segment grows because we already\\nhaving 50% market share and normally auto companies like to buy from at least two suppliers, if not more. So, we are not\\nlooking at a much higher market share than we have today. So, our growth in volumes will largely depend on the growth\\nof market sector. Having said that, once the cold rolling mill with its galvanizing line and the annealing line comes in full,\\nwhat is coming up just now is what we call the PLTCM, which is basically the cold rolling mill. But the annealing and\\ngalvanizing facilities will be commissioned over the next 12 to 14 months. Once that comes in, then you will have a lot\\nmore to add to the product mix. So, while we have a very high market share, let's say, in hot rolled coils, which is over\\n55% - 60% in some cases, in auto, in cold rolled and galvanize we have in the 30% to 40% range.\\nSo, there is a room for us to increase our market share in the galvanized, high end galvanized and cold roll anneal products,\\nwhich we will do over the next three to four years. But overall, if you look at it, auto will always account for 15% to 20% of\\nour overall volume. The other sector, which is quality conscious and which we are pursuing in a big way is Oil and gas.\\nAnd I think the Kalinganagar plant is ideally suited for the Oil and gas segment, and we are making a lot of headway there.\\nSo, we expect that also to account for a big chunk of our value-added sales going forward.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is a question on iron ore merchant sales. Why do we not do some merchant sales as optionality is available?\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nThat optionality is available with the requisite permissions that we need to take, which we've taken. We are doing some\\niron ore sales, but largely our iron ore is meant for captive use because what we are producing, we are consuming. Once\\nthe pellet plant starts, we will be using more iron ore for the pellets because we don't have to then buy pellets. But having\\nsaid that, whenever there is an opportunity to auction iron ore that we can't use because of the grades or whatever, then\\nwe will do that. I think one of the challenges today is not so much about auctioning it, but about the logistics of it. And I\\nthink we have done quite a few rakes of iron ore in the last two, three months. Not yet so material, but yes, it has started.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is then a question on RINL investment. Given our deleveraging target for year 2024 and ahead. Can we confirm\\nthat we are not going to bid for these assets?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think what we've always said is our existing sites allow us the run rate to grow to 40 mn tons, right? So, I think our\\ngrowth ambitions can be fulfilled from our existing sites. But it will be premature for us to emphatically say yes or no\\nbecause there's a competitive environment and why should we announce what we want to do or going to… ahead of when\\nyou need to do it.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nAnd there's another question on India, which says can you assume Rs. 16,000 EBITDA/t for 4Q. So, as you all know, we\\ndon't give a quarterly guidance. So, we will not comment on that. Just moving to Europe, there's a question about if we\\nexpect steel prices in Europe to benefit if CBAM proposal are implemented?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes, certainly, because we should keep in mind that in Europe today, we pay €80 per ton for CO2. I mean, obviously, we\\nget free allowances. So even, despite that, I think we paid something like €100 million a year. So, because the free\\nallowances we get are not covering our needs fully. So that's a cost. We are paying and everyone else in Europe is paying\\ntoday. And as those free allowances go down, you will pay more. So that's why there is a CBAM because if somebody can\\nmake steel, which is more carbon inefficient and ship to Europe without the cost, that's very unfair on the European steel\\nindustry. If you look at Tata Steel in Netherlands, it is the second most carbon-efficient blast furnace in the world. It emits\\nabout 1.8 tons of carbon per ton of steel. So, for blast furnace emitting that kind of carbon to pay €80 per ton, carbon cost\\nand somebody who is, let's say, 2.5, not paying that cost is certainly unfair. So, we expect that CBAM will come in. We\\nexpect that steel prices in Europe will reflect the cost in Europe because some of those costs are unique to Europe and\\nthe industry will need that support.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nAnd there is a question around the energy costs, so given that the spreads have been, our margins have been affected by\\ncoal and gas costs - could the company please report that line separately under expenses for both Europe and India?\\nI would just say all of you know that we give a lot more information than any other steel company in the world actually any\\ncompany in terms of the profit and loss details\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt will get covered in the MD&A when you look at the annual numbers.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is comment I think, are we regretting not considering divesting our international business when the\\nsituation was favourable? Will we revisit this in the next up cycle?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt is a hypothetical question\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think there is a question around debt reduction, do you expect debt reduction in 4QFY23?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, we’ve, in this third quarter itself, paid about Rs. 1,300 crores, but it got offset by the currency valuation. So, in principle\\nthat I can articulate as a company is, we will look for all opportunities to reduce our debt. As I said in my comments that\\ncompletion of Kalinganagar is a priority, but deleveraging is also a very important priority. And therefore, whenever we get\\nopportunity, we'll do so. We do have some scheduled repayments ahead in 2024 coming up and there will be natural\\ndeleveraging itself. And then whatever we get from a surplus cash generation, we would look to prepay our leverage.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is a question on profitability in Europe for 4Q, says your commentary suggested that EBITDA/t will further weaken\\nover third quarter, can you please clarify?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nNo, I think we said it will improve compared to third quarter because while the current estimate is the realisations on an\\naverage for Europe will be £70 per ton lower in 4Q compared to 3Q, but the cost will be about £102 per ton lower, but we\\nare watching all the costs very closely, including gas prices, energy costs which have dropped significantly over the last\\nfew weeks.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on UK. What is way forward on UK given the package is inadequate? When can we see some\\nconcrete steps that you will take?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nAs I mentioned in my comments that we are looking at an optimal model, which is investable, bankable and fix the need\\nof the company. This is not a excel model analysis, it's an engineering analysis and it's a technical analysis, which is\\nongoing. [inaudible] as Naren mentioned, the broader configuration given the current offer of the development, we are\\ngoing to look at it. We've already started looking at it, and we will come back to our Board and take guidance on that. So,\\nit will take a little bit of time, but not indefinitely\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Samita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nWhat is the kind of annual contract negotiation in Europe, can you give us a sense of how different it is?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nCompared to last year? So, like I said, depending on the industry it’s, I think, in the range of €50 to €150 to €200/t, lower\\nthan last year's annual contract prices. But most of last year's annual contract prices were higher than €1,000 per ton. So,\\nI think it's in the €850 to €1,000 range is what we see most of the contracts for this year, which is lower than last year, but\\nhigher than today's spot prices.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on Europe in terms of the investigations around the environmental issues, can you please give us an\\nupdate?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYeah. So, I think largely, it is to do with our operations in Netherlands. Obviously, we're responding to the various notices\\nthat we get etc. There are issues related to the coke plant there and the emissions out of the coke plant and a few other\\ninstances of the past. What we have done over the last few years is one is, of course, we have a roadmap to continue to\\nimprove the situation. Having said that, I must also say, like I said before, that our Dutch plant is certainly one of the cleaner\\nsteel plants in the world, but we are conscious about the feedback from the community and from the regulators and\\nconstantly trying to improve the facilities that we have there. So that work goes on. There are obviously investigations\\ngoing on. There are questions being asked, which we are responding to. We are cooperating with authorities and doing\\nthe best that we can. But having said that, I think we are a responsible corporate, and we will do whatever is the right thing\\nto do.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nAnd one question before we go back to audio is on the forex gain this quarter. It's quite a large amount, can you please\\nexplain this and provide some details.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, this is something which happens every quarter. There are gains and there are losses. So, there is a Tata Steel\\ninvestment in Tata Steel Holding, which is the holding company in Singapore, and it is done through a debt mechanism.\\nSo, whenever there is an FX movement every quarter, it is adjusted. Sometimes it is negative, sometimes it's positive. And\\nthis quarter, as I mentioned, EURUSD and USDINR movements have been quite volatile and resulted in an FX gain, that's\\nbeen accounted for in others.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Tarang Agarwal of Oldbridge Capital.\\nTarang Agarwal, Oldbridge Capital:\\nHi. Three questions from me. Two on Europe and one on India. On Europe, given that your current contracts have been\\npriced at anywhere south of €1,000 per ton. But if I look at the total cost, even if I eliminate the NRV of £55 million, the\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"total cost at least for the last four, five quarters has been trending north of €1,000 per ton. So, is there something that I'm\\nmissing here or from the point of view of how it's going to play out on per ton basis?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nThe only thing I can think of is we have a lot of downstream assets in Europe. So, I don't know if there's any conclusion\\non those costs versus those realisations\\nTarang Agarwal, Oldbridge Capital:\\nSecond, how fungible is the cash between Netherlands and UK?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, in the past, when we used to run Tata Steel Europe, we used it in a very fungible manner. Given the fact that Tata\\nSteel Netherlands has a decarbonization project, we are escrowing and ensuring that we have that capital because that\\nwill be a very material investment that has to be done in TSN. But otherwise, cash moves freely across all entities.\\nTarang Agarwal, Oldbridge Capital:\\nOkay. And my third question that's on the India business. Between BPR, Downstream, IPP and Automotive, if you could\\ngive us a flavour in terms of how the realisations are different.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, in terms of realisations, automotive contracts, the tenures are different for these contracts, right? So, if you look at it,\\nthe automotive contracts are typically three months to six months depending on the customers. So, if you have a rising\\nmarket, the auto contracts look less attractive because the spot prices have gone up above the auto contracts. In a falling\\nmarket, the auto prices will look better. So that always happens, particularly when there's a lot of volatility. But\\nfundamentally, the reason why we pursue auto customers is that they are not price buyers. They look for buying from\\nsuppliers who are approved. So that means your competition is limited to whoever has the approval for supplies. And that's\\nwhy segments like automotive, oil and gas are attractive because you're not reacting to spot prices moving up and down.\\nIPP is where the volumes go because you have many large customers, maybe tubes, earlier cold rollers, now there are\\nnot too many cold rollers who buy hot roll coils. They are all integrated. But these are a volume play, plus you have a\\nvalue-added play in that. Downstream business for Tata Steel is very big. There our policy is more on transfer pricing,\\nwhich is based on an arm’s length basis, but there is obviously a lag. So, if you look at some of the price increases that\\nwe take this quarter, by the time it passes on to our tubes division or the tinplate company on our transfer pricing policies,\\nit may be a month or two into the quarter or at the end of the quarter. So, there is a lag between that. But again, we see\\ndownstream like auto gives us stability in the business. IPP is more the one which you will leverage, when the stable\\nbusinesses are picking up less volumes than we would like to sell them. To answer your question, I would say, on a longterm basis, auto and downstream should rank over IPP.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Sumangal Nevatia of Kotak Securities\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"First question is just some clarification on the UK topic. The entire transformation from BF to EAF, what is the estimated\\ncapex you're looking at? And what is the plan to fund the remaining 50%, assuming we get a 50% grant from the\\ngovernment?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think if you have heard Naren a little while back, our original ask was for a configuration which had an EAF and also\\nthe downstream TSC or thin slab caster, and the rolling mill. So that all was the configuration that we were discussing with\\nthe government. And we said for that, we need to get 50% support. I think what the government has given is partial of\\nwhat our ask was. And therefore, we are relooking at what should be the resizing of the configuration, if to make it\\ninvestable and bankable and value creative. So, I think these three are the foundations of what we are looking at. And I\\ndon't think what we had asked for has happened, and therefore, the original configuration is to be rethought.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nUnderstood. Is it possible to get what is the ask in terms of billion dollars?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo. So at that point of time, it was multiples of the 300, which we had got. But I think, let us not look at that because it's no\\nlonger relevant. What is relevant is what we will now work on and are working on, and which matches up to the partial\\ngrant that the government is willing to give and then go back to the government and saying that this is what we can do at\\nbest.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nOkay. Got it. But given that the UK doesn't earn any free cash flow, how will the remaining part be funded? Will they raise\\ndebt? Or will there be some support from India entity.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo. So that's why I'm saying that when you do the capital allocation, when we see, for example, say that this year's capital\\nexpenditure is say, Rs. 12,000 crores, Rs. 13,000 crores etc. We take every entity into account, it's not India alone. So, I\\nthink this is going to be almost like a new investment. It's not putting money into the current asset. So, this will be as I said,\\n[inaudible]. It will have elements of Tata Steel support. Something if the existing business can give or cannot give, then it\\nwill be externally funded. So, it will be a combination, but I don't know yet what that configuration will be, let's work towards\\nit, and then we will certainly come out and talk about it.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nGot it. That's very clear. And I mean, just hypothetically, if it's possible to discuss what could be plan B here? I mean, we've\\nbeen in discussions with the government since more than two years now. Is there a fixed timeline we are looking to close\\nthis? And what is plan B - divestment or shutting down the plant?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, there is a plan B, there a plan C. But I think unless we cross the hurdle on the planning, now that the government has\\ngiven us a formal proposal or a formal support structure. Let's work on this and see whether we get to that. Otherwise,\\nthere are consequent plan Bs and plan Cs that we can go for.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nAnd I think, to be honest, whatever we do, we also need to discuss with the other stakeholders there, the unions and\\neverybody else. So, it only it would be fair for us to internally discuss before we announce whatever we want to do.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Anupam Gupta of IIFL\\nAnupam Gupta, IIFL\\nWhat is the outlook for net steel realisations and coal consumption cost for India operations for the fourth quarter?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYeah. So, the net realisation for this quarter in India, we were expecting it to be about Rs. 1,400 - 1,500/t higher than last\\nquarter. I say this because while from December, the prices have been going up. I'm looking at average of last quarter. In\\nterms of coal, the coal costs are expected to be about $10 per ton lower this quarter compared to last quarter. The other\\npoint I want to make is this quarter between Europe and India, we'll also have about 0.5 mn tons of additional volumes\\ncompared to last quarter.\\nAnupam Gupta, IIFL\\nOkay. And just one more question. So, we understand that profitability in UK will improve in this quarter versus last quarter,\\nwhat you highlighted. But let's say, over the next one year before your any transformation capex happens, do you think it\\ncan go back to, let's say, a cash neutral situation or you will continue to have some support coming from India or, let's say,\\nlocal level debt coming in Tata Steel Europe?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo, so I think we didn't say it would improve. I think what Naren's comment was it will not worsen is the point. And as I\\nmentioned earlier also that we're coming to the end of life of some of the critical facilities, which will mean that there will\\nbe challenges on costs, and we are trying to run it in a most optimal manner, which will require minimal support from India.\\nThat is what our target is, till we come to a decision, which is relating to what we have discussed fairly at length in this call\\nand how do we look at the future as far as UK is concerned.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nClarifying Koushik's point, I said we will improve, but we will not be out of the woods.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Sumangal Nevatia of Kotak Securities\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nSorry. So, just one pending question. I mean, when do we expect the commercial volumes from KPO phase 2, is it first\\nhalf of 2025 or more like second half of FY25?\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nFirstly, from next year, you will have the FHCR, which is also part of the commercial volumes of KPO. But we should keep\\nin mind that this is value-added to existing hot roll coils. It's not incremental volume, let me put it that way. Incremental\\nvolume will come from the next from FY25. I mean, some of the incremental volume will also come from the second half\\nof this year, simply because we'll have an additional caster in the steel melt shop. We are still working out the volumes\\nthat will come out of it, and we will give you that guidance in the next analyst call. But so, starting from this year, but most\\nof it will start coming from FY25, where first half or second half, I think we'll give you guidance when we talk the next time.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nGot it. And just one last question. In Europe in the past, you said that $50 - $60 per ton at the entire Europe level is cash\\nbreakeven considering the capex, maintenance capex and interest obligations. I mean, when do we see reaching to that\\nlevel? Is it more towards the end of FY24 or more like an FY25 as we see today?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nWhen you say Europe, I think Netherlands is what we just mentioned. As far as UK is concerned, the levels are somewhat\\na little higher than that.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, Netherlands has always been EBITDA positive, cash positive. So, I think last quarter was an exception of being\\nEBITDA negative. But I think on an annual basis, even last year and next year, it will be positive EBITDA for sure\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nPost relining, it will come back.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYeah. So, Netherlands is not the challenge. The challenge is obviously in the UK\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Prashant Kota of Emkay Global\\nPrashant Kota, Emkay Global:\\nSir, my question is more on the coking coal side and the structural issue over this. Sir, you are being used to buying this\\ncoking coal at very high prices. And in fact, sorry for that word but arm-twisting or extend by the other side. Sir, if you take\\na step back and just look at it from an outsider. Sir, this is opposed to being a mutual long-term relationship in which both\\nparties need each other. But here it is one-sided and, I believe the 90% of the volumes are sold on a linked to the index,\\nwhere the index is decided by 10% of the spot. So, this is, it seems to be some sort of anomaly. Sir, what can we do to\\ntake a step back and say collectively be as in Tata Steel as a leader, not only in India, also in Asia because there are also\\npoor regions that currently take a step back and say, okay, we need coal, coal guys need us and there is coal -- bit after\\nmaking some profit on the same? So, can we have a new dialogue or new system of pricing this as an, okay, we can pay\\nyou this much based on what we have made in the last quarter, last couple of quarters. And something like that the way\\nwe have negotiated with auto guys. So, what is the thinking on this.\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think it's obviously in any commercial free markets, the power will shift from the customer to the supplier or supplier\\nto the customer, right? So, when steel prices go up, we get a lot of noise from our customers saying that it shouldn’t go\\nup. I think, in some sense, if you look at the coal companies, they will tell you the same thing. The issue is that coking coal\\nis not a very liquid market, unlike thermal coal, it's a very consolidated market. What is also happening is you have the big\\nminers, and you are the smaller miners. The smaller miners are not getting the funds that they used to get earlier, the\\nfinancing or the insurance that they used to get earlier because coal in general is seen a bad word without drawing a\\ndistinction between thermal coal and coking coal. You can theoretically do, without thermal coal; you can't do without\\ncoking coal for at least the next 30 years, right? So, there is the situation. For India, we are very dependent on Australia\\nas a source. We are vulnerable to weather or climate events, and that makes the liquidity even worse or two years back,\\nwe had a problem in the railways there. So, these events happen, which [inaudible] the coking coal prices. The part that\\nyou, point you made about the indexes is a point where the steel industry globally has taken up both in Europe and in India\\nsaying that the index or most of our contracts are indexed, and that index we believe is not truly reflective of all the\\ntransactions in the market. This is something which is being discussed with the people who issued the index as well as\\nbetween suppliers and customers. But I think, yes, we have a good long relationship with many of the suppliers, but they\\nare doing …they seem to be doing what is right for their shareholders, and we are doing what we think is right for our\\nshareholders. So, I think we, obviously, must find that balance. But the challenge going forward, this is not a sector which\\nis getting a lot of investment for growth. But India is already the largest importer of coking coal and Indian steel capacity is\\ngoing to double over the next 10 years and will double again over the 10 years after that. So, till such time, we have enough\\ngas or hydrogen as an alternative to coking coal, we will be vulnerable to the volatility in the coking coal market\\nPrashant Kota, Emkay Global:\\nSir, apart from that, the net NRV losses and inventory losses across India and Europe, if you could quantify that please,\\nthis quarter, how much was that? Rs. 1,000 crores?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is no NRV as far as India is concerned. There was NRV to the extent of about £55 million, as far as Europe is\\nconcerned.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Anupam Gupta of IIFL\\nAnupam Gupta, IIFL\\nYeah. Sir, I had one question on iron ore sourcing. So, you have that iron ore mine at NINL. So, including that and other\\nmines which you have, can you just lay out iron ore sourcing change over the next 5-6 years and also include let's say,\\nonce the existing mining leases gets over in 2030?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, basically, our desire is not to buy any iron ore, and we've not been buying iron ore. We've been buying pellets, because\\nwe have enough iron ore to take care of our iron ore needs, but we didn't have enough pellets to take care of our pellet\\nneeds. But with the pellet plant coming up in Kalinganagar, which has already come up and over the next few years, we'll\\nbuild another pellet plant in the Angul facility, which is a Bhushan facility. We will be self-sufficient in pellets. So, hopefully,\\nfrom the second quarter of the next financial year, we shouldn't be required to buy any pellets, and we want to keep it that\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"way. The iron ore expansion is being planned to keep pace with our steel expansion, and so that will continue. As far as\\npost 2030 is concerned, as of now we have about 550 mn tons of iron ore reserves for post 2050 -- I mean, 2030 because\\nwe have the Gandhalpada mine, which is a greenfield mine which we bid for and got, which we will develop by the pace\\nthat will be needed.

Good morning and good afternoon to all our viewers joining us today. Welcome to this call to discuss\\nour results for the first quarter ending 30th June 2023. I am joined by our CEO and MD, Mr. T.V. Narendran; and our ED\\nand CFO, Mr. Koushik Chatterjee They will share their thoughts on the results and answer any questions you may have.\\nBefore I hand it to them, I will remind you that the entire conversation today is governed by the safe harbour clause, which\\nis on Page 2 of the presentation, which is uploaded on our website. Thank you, and over to you, Naren.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI'll start with a few comments and then hand over to Koushik. The economic slowdown in key regions has obviously\\nweighed on global commodity prices and steel in general. US and EU continue to face inflationary pressures and a tight\\nmonetary policy, while the Chinese recovery has been more muted than expected. One of the outcomes of this is higher\\nsteel exports from China, which has led to a moderation of global steel prices between May - June 2023. In fact, China\\nwas exporting about 8 million tons a month, which it had last done in 2016. While key steelmaking inputs' – coking coal\\nand iron ore prices did move lower, the steel spot spreads peaked in May before moderating for the rest of the quarter.\\nIn India, the economic activity continued to improve, and the apparent steel consumption was up 10% YoY for the quarter.\\nDespite good domestic demand, steel spot prices declined in line with international prices and sentiments in the market.\\nHot rolled coil prices dropped by about Rs. 4,000 per ton during the quarter in India. Moving to our performance, our crude\\nsteel production in India was around 5 million tons. Production was up 2% YoY but marginally lower on QoQ basis because\\nof planned maintenance shutdowns. And India production now stands at about 70% of the overall portfolio and will continue\\nto rise in the coming years. India deliveries grew 18% YoY, primarily driven by the rise in domestic deliveries to chosen\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"segments such as automotive and retail. And our well-established brands like Tata Tiscon and Tata Steelium had bestever first quarter sales. Our net realisations improved by almost Rs. 1,000 per ton QoQ despite the market movement,\\nprimarily driven by contract sales and product mix.\\nMoving to Europe, our steel deliveries were around 2 million tons in the first quarter. Revenue per ton was up about £33\\nper ton on a QoQ basis. As we had explained in the past, our contract and product mix ensure that our net realisations are\\ndifferent from the benchmark, which is Northwest Europe HRD spot, with a one quarter lag. In the previous quarter, the\\ndrop in NRs was 50% lower than the decline in the benchmark; and consequently, the improvement in this quarter was\\nalso correspondingly lower. Overall, the high revenue per ton was offset by elevated input costs, including energy and the\\nongoing relining of one of the blast furnaces in Netherlands. We had guided last quarter as well, that the blast furnace\\nwould be down for relining. That will obviously impact 1Q and 2Q for us.\\nIn terms of growth, multiple projects are underway across India, and we remain focused on leveraging the expected panIndia growth across steel end-use segments. For instance, we have leading market share in Auto. And the 5 MTPA\\nexpansion at Kalinganagar will aid in consolidating our leadership position in auto and grow our presence in value - added\\nsegments such as oil and gas, solar, etc. Similarly, Neelachal and the upcoming electric arc furnace in Punjab will drive\\nour retail presence. And in terms of reach, we have more than 200 distributors now and over 20,000 dealers. We'll continue\\nto expand our virtual presence with the e-commerce platforms like Aashiyana where our sales in the last 12 months have\\ncrossed Rs. 1,600 crores. We are also looking to grow in downstream portfolio across wires, tubes, ductile iron pipes, and\\ntinplate, where we have a dominant market share. And in tubes, we have recently commissioned, along with our partners,\\n2 new mills, which will increase the capacity in tubes from 1 million tons to about 1.3 million tons.\\nOur investments are strategically focused on business sustainability and growth. Tata Steel is committed to being Net Zero\\nby 2045; and multiple initiatives are already underway, calibrated to each operating location. In the Netherlands, we are\\npursuing Roadmap+ for the last few years to bring about significant reduction in emissions, dust, odour, and noise. We\\nare also engaged in discussions with our technology providers and the government as we make choices on the process\\nroute and the technology and transition to green steel as we have promised to do over the next few years. In India, we've\\nundertaken various trials, including injecting hydrogen in the blast furnace to reduce emissions; and have also initiated\\nmeasures to replace around 379 MW of coal-based power with renewable energy.\\nLooking ahead, in India, the domestic demand remains supported by government spending and improving consumption\\nacross end-use segments. However, the drop in international prices and seasonality have dampened prices. We expect a\\ndrop in realisations of around Rs. 3,100 per ton in 2Q compared to 1Q, but we will, of course, benefit from the drop in\\ncoking coal consumption by about $57 per ton on QoQ basis. In Europe, our net realisations are expected to drop by about\\n£38 per ton. Coking coal consumption is expected to improve by about $46 per ton QoQ. The ongoing relining, as I've\\nmentioned earlier, of one of the blast furnaces is taking time and will obviously continue to impact costs in the second\\nquarter as it did in the first quarter. Separately, the upgradation of the cold rolling mill, where we had some issues post\\nupgradation, is now getting resolved; and we should be back to normal production there as well. Thank you. And over to\\nKoushik.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you, Naren. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to all those who have joined in. I will begin with the\\nquarterly performance provided on Slide 23. Our consolidated revenue stood at about Rs. 59,490 crores with improvement\\nin realisations across geographies despite the uncertain operating environment and moderation in global steel prices. Our\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'consolidated EBITDA stood at about Rs. 6,122 crores, which translates to a consolidated margin of 10%. At the Tata Steel\\nstandalone level, the EBITDA stood at Rs. 7,348 crores, which translates to an EBITDA per ton of Rs. 15,895. Excluding\\nthe forex impact, the EBITDA was slightly higher at about Rs. 7,403 crores. As provided on Slide 28, there was drop in\\nEBITDA on absolute basis primarily due to lower volumes compared to the previous quarter, as the fourth quarter is\\ntypically a seasonally stronger quarter. Within costs, material costs were down, but this was partly offset by higher\\nconversion costs on account of royalty related expenses which increase normally with a lag. The royalty increased by\\nabout Rs. 353 crores to about Rs. 1,315 crores due to higher notified IBM prices. Overall, the EBITDA margin was stable\\nat about 23% QoQ. Further improved profitability was witnessed in the Neelachal operations, which turned EBITDA positive\\nwithin 9 months of the acquisition.\\nAt Tata Steel Europe, EBITDA loss stood at about £153 million; and on a per ton basis was broadly similar to the fourth\\nquarter and in line with the guidance that we gave. As shown in Slide 30, the steel production was lower QoQ given the\\nrelining of one of the blast furnaces in Netherlands, but deliveries were close to 2 million tons, as we began to consume\\nthe built-up stocks. Improvements in revenue per ton were broadly offset by elevated costs, including energy. As previously\\nexplained, we have hedges in place, and the drop in spot natural gas prices will take a quarter to reflect in the P&L.\\nOther income has increased by about Rs. 1,000 crores QoQ, primarily driven by the increase in standalone accounts. We\\nhave signed a lease agreement with Tata Steel BlueScope Limited, which is a 50 - 50 joint venture with BlueScope\\nAustralia for the coated lines at Meramandali and Khopoli. And this led to the reclassification of these assets, and\\naccordingly it is reflected in the accounts. Consolidated PAT considers a gain of about Rs.338 crores, which is net of tax,\\non account of this transaction.\\nLet me speak a few words about the taxes, which stood at about Rs. 1,331 crores. The current tax was about Rs. 1,027\\ncrores and was broadly in line with the tax and profitability of the India operations. The deferred tax was about Rs. 303\\ncrores on a net basis and is a combination of movement at various entities. We have completed the buy-in of the remaining\\nliabilities, and with this, the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS) has been successfully derisked. Like previous instances,\\nthis has led to a non-cash deferred tax of about Rs. 1,200 crores. However, this has been partly offset by other non-cash\\ndeferred tax credits at other facilities such as Europe. I would like to mention that there is a residual asset surplus relating\\nto BSPS in the books of about £200 million. As we get the execution completed with Legal & General, this will also be\\nreflected as a non-cash deferred tax charge in the future.\\nThe volatility in the steel markets has also impacted working capital and cash flows. There has been a build-up of around\\nRs. 2,500 crores in this quarter. However, this was more due to the price effect, as our working capital number of days\\nremained stable at around 34 days compared to about 37 days in fourth quarter. Moreover, in the last 12 months, we have\\nreleased about Rs. 9,200 crores through the various working capital measures that we have taken as a management.\\nWe continue to commit to growth in India, as Naren mentioned, and spent about Rs. 4,089 crores on capital expenditure\\nduring the quarter. We have been steadily prioritising growth in India, and our overall capex spend has been about Rs.\\n15,500 crores in the last 12 months. This will obviously lead to a consolidation of our market position. At Kalinganagar, the\\n5 MTPA expansion plan will drive volumes as well as positively impact our fixed costs coverage. We continue to prioritise\\nKalinganagar growth and have spent close to about Rs. 18,900 crores till date. Apart from that, we have started\\ncommissioning the 2.2 MTPA cold rolling mill in phases. The full hard cold rolled coil is already being produced. The CAL\\nand the galvanising lines will be commissioned subsequently. Furthermore, the savings in operational efficiency on account\\nof the 6 MTPA pellet plant has started to begin reflecting in our performance. In IJmuiden, the ongoing relining of the BF6\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"is being financed by internal accruals of TSN operations. The upgradation of the cold mill (CM21) is close to completion.\\nWhile the relining of BF6 will weigh on performance in the next quarter, there will also be product mix improvement on\\naccount of the cold mill upgrade. Neelachal has ramped up as well and is now close to operating capacity at the rated\\ncapacity of about 0.9 million tons. The coke plant will be commissioned in this quarter and is expected to drive cost\\nefficiencies in the future. Overall, the working capital and cash flows on account of higher capex, have led to an increase\\nin the net debt of about Ra. 3,600 crores on QoQ basis, which is now about Rs. 71,397 crores. Our finance costs are\\nbroadly stable on a QoQ basis. Net debt to EBITDA is about 2.9x, and Net debt to equity is 0.69x. The group liquidity\\nremained strong at about Rs. 30,500 crores, including Rs. 19,000 crores of cash and cash equivalent.\\nAs stated, we are keen to prioritise growth in India and are recalibrating our deleveraging targets accordingly given where\\nthe market conditions are. We are now looking to continue to deleverage. That will remain the priority over the next couple\\nof years but focus on growth continues to take higher and higher priority. Sustainability is the core of our strategy, which\\nincludes providing comprehensive disclosures. We published our first Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report,\\nwhich you would have read, covering about 14 entities that make up about 98% of our revenues. We have also published\\nthe climate change report, aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD, in the integrated report of FY23.\\nFinally moving to the UK, we are in regular and intense conversations with the government, who have also indicated their\\nwillingness to secure a decarbonised and competitive future for the UK steel industry. Tata Steel has clearly articulated\\nthat the solutions have to be implemented quickly, has to be financeable in an effective manner, and will require to transition\\nout of some of the end-of-life assets. So, this is broadly where we are, as far as our performance and the future of Tata\\nSteel is concerned. Thank you, and over to the floor for Q&A. Thank you.\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\nOperator\\nThe first question is from Sumangal Nevatia of Kotak Securities.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nMy first question is on the Europe division. If you could just share what is our outlook on returning back to breakeven and\\n[inaudible] positive at the EBITDA level over the next few quarters. And overall, are we seeing light at the end of the tunnel?\\nWe have been incurring almost $800 million annualised loss at the EBITDA level over the last 3 quarters. What are our\\ntargets and views for next 1 to 2 years? And do we have any stiff targets, as far as return on capital employed is concerned,\\nunder which we will decide to take some tough decisions as far as that business division is concerned?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So, I'll give you some inputs and then Koushik can supplement. If you look at the last 3 quarters, 3Q of last year was\\nwhen the highest energy prices and the lowest demand was witnessed, as the conflict in the UK panned out. While we did\\nhave some hedges to protect us for some quarters – this was where we had a challenge – particularly in Netherlands. UK\\nis separate. And if I look at Netherlands, it has always been an EBITDA-positive, cash-positive business which had not\\nrequired support from India, but the last 2 quarters have been different for these reasons: One is we were hit by these\\ninput costs going up very significantly, thanks to the conflict. And secondly, as we guided in the last quarter, there's a blast\\nfurnace relining which meant, out of the 2 blast furnaces, 1 blast furnace was shut down for 6 months. That means 1Q and\\n2Q of this year, so you're seeing the impact of that. We did stock up on slabs. That is why the sales drop has not been as\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"much as the production drop, but those fixed costs which we have for a 7 million ton production is now distributed over a\\nmuch lower production, which is reflecting in core numbers.\\nUK is a bit more reflective of softer steel prices. And often times when we have softer steel prices, we do have a challenge\\nin UK. As Koushik said, in UK there is a conversation going on with the government to find a long-term solution, which we\\nhope will come to a conclusion in the next few months. And in Netherlands, also apart from the blast furnace starting up\\nin the second half of the year and going back to normal production levels, there is a transition plan being made, so as far\\nas the operating performance is concerned, Netherlands should come back to normal levels, which is typically cash positive\\nand EBITDA positive. We should come back to those levels in the second half of the year, but UK, yes, has some structural\\nchallenges which we are trying to deal with. Koushik, do you want to supplement on what I said?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nLet me just try to articulate the 2 parts. I think, the next quarter will have, as Naren guided, pressure on prices. In\\nNetherlands, our relining will get completed more around the end of next quarter, the early part of the third quarter. And\\nfrom third quarter, onwards, I think Netherlands will certainly come back to its normal operating levels. Maybe, the second\\nhalf of the third quarter, onwards, it will certainly come back to its operating level. We expect that Netherlands will continue\\nto be strong in the context of the market that exists there. And it has, historically, if I look at last decade of numbers, it has\\nalways, as Naren mentioned, been a PAT-positive and a cash-positive business, so we expect to do that. We are also\\ntaking a lot of efforts in terms of structurally improving that. And that is going to have a cost impact or cost takeout impact,\\nbut it will not happen in this year [inaudible]. We will have to become ready for the decarbonisation in Netherlands. That's\\nthe reason the cost structure will start getting aligned to the decarbonised position, which will happen in a few years’ time.\\nIn the UK, we would certainly see in the next couple of quarters a similar kind of performance. As I mentioned and as\\nNaren mentioned, we will enter a decisive position sometime in H2 of the year. And we will have to take calls, and which\\nis under consideration, and we will have to come to a different operating structure and operating model. But that would not\\nhappen before March 2024. The process will take time and that is what we will be looking at in the long term. In the next\\n2 - 3 years, we will certainly look at a different operating model. Depending on the conversations with the government, we\\nwill then have to look at reconfigured hardware in the UK and see where it goes. I am sure that we will have the time and\\nopportunity to talk more in detail as we go along in the second half of the year. And like you, we are extremely mindful of\\nthe EBITDA losses and performance losses that happened in the European portfolio, but I can also assure you that we\\nare working towards a structurally more robust operating configuration in both UK and in the Netherlands.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nThat's very reassuring. My second question is on the capacity expansion. One is on KPO-2 blast furnace. We are nearing\\nthe commissioning maybe sometime towards the end of the year, so now since we are not many quarters away. Is it\\npossible to give some specific timeline, as far as which quarter we can see commercial production to start from KPO-2?\\nNumber two, we've put a very impressive and informative Slide 11 in our deck, as far as 2030 expansion timelines and\\npotential of reaching 40 million tons. The important element here is the iron ore because, by 2030, what I understand, all\\niron ore mines will be put on auction. We might not be able to retain all of them, so what's our strategy on iron ore given\\nthat we are now articulating our 2030 target, as far as steel capacity is concerned?\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So as far as Kalinganagar is concerned, the cold rolling mill and pellet plant have already started working. The\\ngalvanising lines, annealing lines will get commissioned over the next few quarters. The blast furnace is expected to come\\non by February-March. That's the current timeline. Blast furnaces, as you know, ramp up quite fast, so if we have a good\\nramp-up, you should start seeing the volume impact clearly next year, which is the next financial year. The steel melt shop,\\nwe should be adding another stream, another caster, so that should add about 0.5 million tons straight away. We will get\\nsome benefit of that this year. That should start by October or November, but the full benefit will come once the blast\\nfurnace comes and the complete steel melt shop expansion is done. So, I think FY25 is when you will start seeing the\\nvolume impact. I think we'll give you more specific guidance closer to that, but you will start seeing the volume impact. The\\ncost impact is already being felt because, with the pellet plant commissioned, we have stopped buying pellets. We used\\nto buy a lot of pellets. We have also started shipping pellets to Meramandali from Kalinganagar, so our cost impact is\\nalready being felt. Cold rolling mill will again help us with margins if not with volumes, because you're converting hot rolled\\ninto more value-added products, but the additional volume will start coming from second half of the year in terms of the\\nsteel melt shop. And that's why, in the beginning of the year, we had guided a 1.5 million ton increase in volume this year\\ncompared to last year. And some of it was coming from Kalinganagar, and some of it from Neelachal.\\n\\nAs far as our 2030 plans is concerned, all our existing mines, as in the mines which we have had for a long time, will come\\nup for auction in 2030. As per the law, we have a right of first refusal. In any case, we will participate in the auctions, so\\nwe can always bid for it and bid to win if we want to. So that is one option. Secondly, we participated in an auction. We've\\ngot a mine already, the Gandhalpada mine. In addition to that, one of the reasons we bid for Neelachal is that it has about\\n110 million tons of iron ore. With Bhushan, we got another 100 million tons. The Gandhalpada mine is about 350 million\\ntons. And with the Usha Martin steel business acquisition, we got about 25 million tons. So, we already have about 500\\nmillion tons of iron ore with us, which is with us for the next 30 - 40 years. Obviously, that is not sufficient for the kind of\\nvolumes at which we will be operating, so we will continue to bid for more iron ore mines between now and 2030. We have\\nthe option to bid for the mines which will expire in 2030. So, the objective is, of course, to make sure that we are secured\\non iron ore and obviously manage the weighted average cost of our iron ore. There may be some mines where we may\\nhave to bid more.\\nOperator\\nThe next question from Satyadeep Jain of Ambit Capital.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit\\nThe blast furnace relining will be complete in another quarter or so and the energy hedges roll off. Given where the spreads\\nare, and given all these tailwinds from rolling-off of energy hedges and completion of blast furnace relining, could we\\npossibly look at breakeven EBITDA for the entire European entity by the end of third quarter? And tied to that would be in\\nthe annual report there was a target of $1 billion for debt reduction and working capital reduction. We have seen working\\ncapital increase and debt increase in this quarter, but would management maintain that target for the entire FY24?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nWe certainly expect the Netherlands business to be positive EBITDA in the second half. Plan for the year is for it to be\\nEBITDA positive for the whole year. If you look at the current spreads, they are in the range of €260 - 270 per ton, which\\nis better than normally you look at €225 - 240 per ton. The reason those spreads in the last year became less relevant is\\nwhen you look at spreads, you don’t look at the electricity prices and gas prices. Spread was looked at only iron ore, coal,\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"and steel prices. Because electricity and gas prices were typically about €30 - 40 per ton, it was not as material as iron\\nore and coal. But over the last year, that went to €120 levels. Now it is settling back at €70 - 90 per ton levels and as it\\ncomes back, spreads at €270 per ton will also be very comfortable. In the second half of the year, you will see the lower\\nenergy prices coming back to more normal levels. We will also see the production back to normal levels, which will make\\nsure that our costs are back to normal. So that's why Netherlands is very clearly back on track in the second half of the\\nyear, but I think UK is where we have a challenge. We are still looking at the numbers for 2H. And at this point in time, I\\nthink we will wait for the 2Q call to give you a guidance for 2H on UK.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nFor the full year, certainly Netherlands will be in positive EBITDA; and that's what we are going to be working on. It will\\nstart certainly from the third quarter. And then we will look at fourth quarter as it comes, but full year, our target is certainly\\nto be that. In the UK, there will be pressures on this as it is continuing at this point of time. On an underlying basis, for the\\ncombined European entity, we will certainly focus towards being breakeven. On a reported basis, if we move on to taking\\nstructural actions in both Netherlands and in UK in particular, there would be a structural cost takeout that will get reflected\\nin the reported numbers in the second half. In the second half, on underlying, we will continue to focus on the breakeven\\nand including moving towards a positive zone. But on the reported side, if we have to take structural actions, especially on\\nthe UK, some of these actions will have cost implications which will get reflected in the second half results.\\nOn your question on the debt. I think, sometime back when we had an Investor Day, we essentially said, and I think I can\\nremember I was criticised for saying that, why is your Net debt to EBITDA target so high. Because you would be swimming\\nin money. But I think we have taken the right call to say that it will be between 2x and 2.5x. That Net debt to EBITDA goal\\nwill continue to be there. It is not something that we have on a QoQ basis, but certainly on a YoY basis, we will try to\\nadhere to those levels including with the higher capital allocation. But if there are extraordinary costs that comes in because\\nof events such as the blast furnace relining in Europe, those kinds of things do have to be absorbed to ensure sustainability\\nof the business. Such things distort it for a while but does not take our eye off the ball, as far as deleveraging is concerned.\\nWe will continue to be in that zone. Maybe, when we are allocating peak capex, which can get breached for a while but\\nagain come back because that capex is meant for good purpose and increase our EBITDA in due course of time. I would\\nstick to that parameter and ensure that our deleveraging is also a same priority as we grow on our capex, but in India, we\\nare seeing a multitude of pipeline of growth, be it in Kalinganagar at this point of time or the EAF in Ludhiana. The pipeline\\nis really strong, so therefore we are really looking at it. While deleveraging and keeping the balance sheet at investment\\ngrade is a big priority for us, I think we will try to balance between that as well as keeping the growth engine on in a\\nsubstantial manner. So, I think what you need to track, which is the 2.5x Net debt to EBITDA, which in this quarter is at\\n2.9x. By the end of the year, we will certainly want to bring it back to that 2.5x level.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit\\nSecond question, on the European decarbonisation. In the presentation, it is mentioned the blast furnace 1 will be\\ntransitioned by FY30, so can you remind us? When is the relining due for the other BF in Netherlands? How long would it\\ntake for that to complete? And the capex for that transition. Regarding, carbon border adjustment tax, that there is talk in\\nIndia of a voluntary carbon pricing. If companies want to take that lower price and use that to ship products to Europe, how\\nwould European steel companies generate ROCE on the decarbonisation capex?\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo firstly, in Netherlands, basically one blast furnace, which is called the BF6, is being relined. The bigger blast furnace,\\nBF7, which produces 3.5 million tons, is up for relining maybe in 2026 - 27. The plan is what we have already said when\\nwe did the BF6 relining, is this is the last relining that we are doing; because we want to transition away from blast furnaces,\\ninto DRI-based production with an electric arc furnace to support it and later maybe a reducing electric furnace (REF). So\\nthose discussions are going on internally on phasing the right technology based on the technology maturity and the product\\nmix and other conditions, so that work is pretty advanced. And a lot of work has been done already. Already, the\\nengineering work has been done on some of these options. We are having very detailed conversations with the\\nNetherlands government. So, in Netherlands, the advantage we have is a lot of this transition can be supported by the\\ncash flows that we generate out of Netherlands, so we are looking at how can we find that optimal balance between the\\ncash flows that we generate, the support that we get from the government and any project financing that we may take for\\nthat project. So that work is going on, but it is something that we expect to be self-sufficient and taking care of itself. As far\\nas what you asked. See basically the carbon border adjustment mechanism is linked to the tax, carbon tax, that we pay in\\nEurope based on the carbon footprint that we have, so if you look at it from that perspective: Already our Dutch plant is\\none of the most carbon-efficient plants in the world. It has a carbon emission of 1.8 tons per ton of steel compared to Tata\\nSteel in Jamshedpur, which is at 2.11 and the best in India, all right? So, if you were to apply the carbon tax, anybody\\nshipping from India with a higher carbon footprint will be at a disadvantage. And I don't think the European government is\\ngoing to allow anyone to ship material without paying that carbon tax when the local industry is already paying that carbon\\ntax. Because then you're penalising more carbon-efficient industries like the one we have in IJmuiden and importing steel\\nfrom less-carbon-efficient process routes. So, I think the way carbon border adjustment mechanism is framed is to look at\\nyour carbon footprint and pay tax accordingly. Now if you can make steel in India with a lower carbon footprint and ship it\\nto Europe, that's a different matter, but today our European facility is one of the most carbon efficient in the world, so if you\\napply the principles of carbon border adjustment mechanism, we won't be any less competitive than we are today. And as\\nwe transition into a greener process route, that carbon footprint comes even lower. So, I think, while in India, the carbon\\nborder adjustment mechanism is being discussed at multiple levels, but from a European standpoint, it's not just us. Most\\nof the steel industry in Europe and the governments in Europe are supporting this transition. And I'm sure that they will\\nensure that in Europe there is no unfair competition from less-carbon-efficient sources.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe CBAM is actually a carbon equalisation process, so therefore, if any company in India, and for that matter, anywhere\\nelse in the world, was to adopt voluntary internal carbon pricing, which has to reflect in the product that goes to Europe.\\nSo just adopting an internal carbon pricing will not change the embedded carbon. You have to actually produce the product\\nwhich has equalised carbon or less carbon than what European standards will provide. I think that it's kind of an illusion.\\nIf somebody were to think that [inaudible]. Tata Steel today applies $40 internal carbon pricing, but as Naren mentioned,\\nour carbon footprint is 2.1, so that doesn't make us any way competitive with the CBAM if it was to come in force today.\\nWe have to reduce it to the average levels of carbon which CBAM will specify in 2026, so I think that needs to be cleared\\nin our minds, and all the transitions that are happening in Europe are looking at a sustainable business case and an\\ninvestment case for this transition, which I would presume would be in the zone of between, say, 8 – 12% of ROIC.\\nOperator\\nThe next question from Pinakin Parekh of JP Morgan\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Pinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nYes. Sir, my first question is going back to the debt reduction. Is it fair to say that now the $1 billion absolute net debt\\nreduction guidelines that we had at the beginning of the year now would not stand and we should look more at Debt to\\nEBITDA, which would mean that the absolute debt could be higher?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nLet me correct myself. The Net debt to EBITDA is a frame that we are looking at. Earlier, we said 2x - 2.5x, if you recall,\\nwhen we had that conversation on the Investor Day. That continues to be our frame. The $1 billion debt reduction number\\nis also a number that we will continue to pursue, but the question is – for example, this quarter, we had about Rs. 7,200\\ncrores of repayment which partly we had to refinance. So that's why you don't see it in this, because the working capital\\nincrease and the capex increase have offset that number, and as a result of which, you see a Rs. 71,000 crores net debt\\nnumber. Going forward, in the next quarter, we have Rs. 4,500 crores, part of which will be repaid. So, we will continue to\\ndo that on a gross basis, but the fact is that our allocation of capex is also increasing. And there is some volatility which\\nyou can see in the coal prices and steel prices, which is reflecting in the working capital. If I were to take out the working\\ncapital impact, we would have certainly seen a net debt reduction. [inaudible] This is because it is not on the gross basis\\nbut on net basis because fundamentally the raw material prices or the coal prices moved sharply down, the creditors\\nnumbers came down. So, I don't see that we are giving up on the $1 billion target. We may surpass it, or we may fall short\\nof it, but we will keep working on that $1 billion and also the Net debt to EBITDA number, so there are 2 frames in this\\nequation. We will continue to do that. All that I said is then our capex allocation are increasing more than what we have\\ndone in the past. In the past, we have also put deleveraging ahead of capex, and by which, we have also slowed down\\nour capex, like Kalinganagar, which in hindsight has not helped us. So, the ongoing capex is not starved of funds. We will\\ncontinue to push that, start getting the output of that kind of growth and continue to deleverage. It's not a binary thing,\\nhonestly, Pinakin, actually it works in parallel, and we have to manage it based on the circumstances of each quarter and\\neach year as it comes across.\\nPinakin Parekh, JP Morgan\\nSure. So just to follow up: If we were to take a view of the next 12 months, yes, there is India capex. And there are volatile\\nearnings, but is there a risk to the target $1 billion net debt reduction not being met because of unforeseen spending in\\nEurope, especially in UK? Between the India capex, the Europe capex, and the debt reduction, we understand the priority\\nis India capex, but what between Europe and the debt reduction?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think it's a valid point. Let's look at FY23. We had a similar $1 billion target, but we did not meet it because we started\\nallocating more and more capex to Kalinganagar and the volatility in working capital did affect. In Europe, for example,\\nNetherlands is sitting on almost €0.5 billion of cash and that is reflected in the net debt number because you have that\\ncash sitting there. Now the blast furnace relining, for example, is funded through internal generations and internal cash of\\nTata Steel Netherlands. And that is going to reflect in the net debt also if you are stopping your production because of the\\nblast furnaces. And therefore, it will get related, but it will come back again and replenish that because that is actually the\\ncorpus. And we add to that corpus to ensure that decarbonisation in Netherlands is done primarily by government support\\nas well as by internal cash flows, and that's how we are going to structure that stuff. Now in the UK, if there are any\\nextraordinary structural cost that as I said is incurred, that will take cash out of the system. And I think that is important\\nbecause, once we have done that, we will actually ensure that we get into a level where that cash bleed comes down very\\nsignificantly, if not to a neutral and positive zone. If I look at till July 2024, there is certainly the objective of ensuring that\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"we repay on the basis of some of our scheduled repayments, which doesn't get refinanced but paid out. That will be one\\ntarget. And secondly, how we optimise on the cash that we may have to pay out to do any restructuring, as far as Tata\\nSteel UK is concerned.\\nOperator\\nThe next question from Amit Murarka of Axis Capital.\\nAmit Murarka, Axis Capital\\nThe first question is on Europe again. The energy hedges have actually been impacting numbers as you have highlighted.\\nCould you just help understand generally like what is the periodicity of these hedges? And what is the quantum of impact\\nthat could be coming in [inaudible] subsequent quarters?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo typically, we hedge, I think, 3 quarters at 25% every quarter. So that's why, in some sense, 1Q and 2Q would be the\\npeak of what we hedged maybe 3 quarters back, right? In some sense, 1Q was a peak. You will see if I add the gas prices\\nand electricity prices on a pound per ton basis, 1Q is the highest, 2Q will start dropping and then 3Q, 4Q will drop further.\\nSo that's pretty much a trajectory. Most of the drop will come in 2H. So that's why the benefits will accrue more in 2H than\\nin 1H.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo, that's perfectly fine. Actually, the hedging happens on a rolling basis and an increased percentage basis. We also\\nreworked the approach to it given the volatility because when the prices are the maximum, the view from the entire analyst\\ncommunity is it will remain like this. And that kind of also helps us to take the hedges, but then the market has moved very\\ndifferently. So, one is working on consensus, the other one is to also get a sense as to how the market moves, and how\\nmuch is the risk appetite to keep it open. So, I think you will see that the impact of the hedges will wear out, and the energy\\nprices are a lot more range bound at this point of time. So that would not kind of make too much of an impact going forward.\\nAmit Murarka, Axis Capital\\nSure. And is that possible to quantify, like what could be the hit of those hedges in 1Q?\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. So, we can share the details with you. And just to add, in FY22, actually, we benefited from the hedges. If you see\\nhow the spot prices had moved because we had hedges in place, our costs were actually much lower in FY23. In FY24,\\nwe will see some of that impact, and we can share the number with you.\\nAmit Murarka, Axis Capital\\nSure. My next question is also on Europe. So, this quarter, like at least from the reported P&L, I see that there's almost a\\n$60 - $65 per ton QoQ improvement in the realisation. If I remember right, you had guided for a much lower, $15, or so. Is\\nthere any one-off in that? Or has it been much better than you thought?\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nWe'll come back to you on this. But lastly, if I remember right, both the cost guidance and the net realisation guidance for\\n1Q compared to 4Q was pretty close to what we have guided. And basically, our guidance for 2Q is £38 per ton reduction\\nin realisations in Europe and about Rs. 3,200 per ton reduction in realisations in India. To some extent, this is to be\\nsupplemented by coking coal consumption prices reducing by about $50 per ton in both Europe and in India. In 1Q\\ncompared to 4Q, the guidance on the coal consumption was also close to what we guided.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Just to add to that, Amit, while the NRs and the coal guidance we've discussed, I think there were some additional\\ncosts because of the cold rolled mill taking a little more time to stabilise. And of course, the blast furnaces being down. So,\\nsome of these costs have actually impacted the profitability, which is what you're seeing.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Indrajit Agarwal of CLSA.\\nIndrajit Agarwal, CLSA\\nI have 2 questions. First, can you explain better the BlueScope arrangement? What exactly have we done here? And what\\nkind of advantages can we see?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Tata BlueScope is a 50-50 JV, which has been in force since FY06. And it is a very significant player in the coated\\nproducts market, especially building systems and construction. So as per the JV agreement, all the coated products in the\\nbuilding systems space are being done or should be done by the JV. Now when we acquired Bhushan Steel, we actually\\nhad similar product lines in Bhushan, [inaudible]. To ensure that we are consistent as far as the JV principles are\\nconcerned, we actually agreed with BlueScope that we will ensure that we have a long - term lease of these facilities and\\nassets into the BlueScope JV. And that JV will effectively continue to face the market, make the products. The substrate\\ncomes from Tata Steel, and it continues to ensure that system-wise, we are compliant with the JV agreement and, more\\nimportantly, the market continues to be fed in a more aggressive manner on the coated products, which is a very value added segment, and growing very significantly. So that is fundamentally the arrangement. The accounting implications of\\nthat, which is essentially then you derecognise the assets in your books and convert it into lease assets and we will\\ncontinue to get the lease charge as well as margin on those assets going forward. This will be earnings for Tata Steel.\\nIndrajit Agarwal, CLSA\\nSo effectively, when we look at the release, then it moves from EBITDA to other income. Is that correct?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThat's correct. The turnover goes, the EBITDA goes, and it goes to the other income.\\nIndrajit Agarwal, CLSA\\nSo, the current other income run rate could continue in the foreseeable future right or there is a one-off?\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo, no. Not in this manner. It will be in the form of a lease charges. So, this is a fair valuation transfer that has happened,\\nwhich is what has got reflected. What will come in the future is basically the lease charge as well as the marginal capital\\ncharge and the margin on the leased assets. So that number will be much smaller.\\nIndrajit Agarwal, CLSA\\nMy second question is about Europe There are lots of news floating around what kind of support the UK government is\\nextending. Where are we on the discussions currently? What kind of support are we looking for and what is it that is\\npromised?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think what I would suggest is that, let us complete the whole discussion with the government because there is not just a\\nsupport from a money point of view. There is also support from policy point of view. There is a lot more other enabling\\nsupport that we are in discussion about. They have accelerated and picked up speed, and we would hope to come to a\\nframe. As I said that in the second half of the year, we will be in a better position to actually come out and say what is our\\nplan for UK going forward.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Tarang Agarwal of OldBridge Capital.\\nTarang Agarwal, OldBridge Capital\\nI have a couple of questions. One on Slide 10 of the presentation, it's mentioned that about 23% of the capex was for\\nenvironmental and social initiatives. Is it 23% of the entire capex for FY23? And second, what is the absolute level of\\nworking capital as on 30th June? While you have explained it in a fair bit of detail as to how you see it, I just wanted to\\nunderstand is there an absolute target that you would operate with, given the overall cash flow of the business?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThis 23% of the capex for environment and social is based on a total portfolio basis. That's what we have disclosed in the\\npast also.\\nTarang Agarwal, OldBridge Capital\\nSo that's 23% of all the capex spend in FY '23?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIf I look at it, a large part of capex in Europe, be it Netherlands, in the UK, in India, we have what we call as category 1,\\nwhich includes environment, which includes the license to operate, those kinds of categories, which are compulsory capex,\\nwhich is safety capex and so on. Those all taken together is this number.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nIt would include investments being made to improve emissions, many other, reduce CO 2, whatever, all that will come under\\nthat.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nTo answer your question on working capital, I think fundamentally, what we are saying is the gross working capital, which\\nwe manage mostly by number of days holding, whether it's inventory, finished goods, spares, slabs, and any work in\\nprogress has been pretty tight.\\nNow for example, there are special situations. For example, Netherlands was stocking up slabs for the blast furnace relining\\nshutdown. So, there was an increase that happened in the last 3 quarters. But this quarter, for example, Netherlands is\\ndeeply positive in working capital release because those slabs been consumed. So fundamentally, we look at it in the\\nefficiency metrics in number of days. And that is what is the main part. The second bit of it is the creditors, which is the net\\nof effect on the working capital, which goes up and down based on the large buys on coal and iron ore, especially in\\nEurope. Now that is a fluctuating bit, which ensures that we continue to manage this bit in the manner in which the creditor\\nline can be as flat as possible. The volatility of price effect does come in. In gross working capital also the volatility of steel\\nprices gets into the debtors as well as into the finished goods. So, we manage these metrics, and we have seen this\\nvolatility not only with us, but all our peers, because that is the way with long supply chain, especially on coal and for iron\\nore. These do have fluctuating impacts. Even within that, we then optimise on the number of days.\\nTarang Agarwal, OldBridge Capital\\nJust one more last question then for the annual report. If I look at the standalone financials, the capitalised expenses are\\nin the order of about Rs. 4,500 crores. And our capex in the standalone financials was in the order of about Rs. 9,800\\ncrores. Is my understanding right that a reasonable part of the capex in the standalone financial has gone in for the Rs.\\n4,500 crores of pre - operating expenses?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nWe don't have pre-operating expenses. What we do is we capitalise at the end of the year assets which are commissioned.\\nAnd therefore, of the total capex, it is actually additive rather than being a subset. Some part of it will be work in progress,\\nsome part of it will be capitalised. These 2 should add up to the capex that we spend for the year.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Ritesh Shah of Investec.\\nRitesh Shah, Investec:\\nA couple of questions. Sir, you indicated residual surplus of £200 million pertaining to BSPS. How should one understand\\nthe cash flow impact over here?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nCash flow impact is zero. There is no cash flow impact. The BSPS is a separate entity. And this was in our books, and as\\nwe did the buy-in with the insurance company, the assets, and liabilities both started going away. And it had surplus\\nbecause that's the surplus that helped us to do the buy in. As it went out, the surplus also went out. And when you take\\nout the surplus, then the deferred tax impact, which is a noncash impact, hit the P&L. There is no cash flow impact in the\\nentire buy in that we have done of £8 billion.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ritesh Shah, Investec:\\nSir, the reason I ask is, I think end March, there was a surplus of around Rs. 6,600 crores, and there is a technical\\nrequirement of 103% of the liability, which the insurer would like to have. It might leave out certain quantum. Is there a\\nhope that, that could come back to the India balance sheet? The question was more pertaining from that angle.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo hopes for that because it is a separate entity, which gets consolidated in the TSUK books and hence in Tata Steel\\nbooks. But this is completely a noncash transaction. The bit on the surplus is the trigger point with not only the insurance\\ncompany, but also with the trustees that when it reaches a surplus, we can do a full derisking, which is why it's, in effect,\\na lock, stock barrel transfer in parts, and that's what we have achieved. And in the end, there will be some residual, which\\nwill also have to be taken out because we are not the owners of the assets. The owners have moved into the insurance\\ncompany. So, there's no cash flow impact positive or negative that will happen\\nRitesh Shah, Investec:\\nSir, second, you indicated we'll take a decisive action on Tata Steel UK. Why did you use the word decisive? Specifically,\\nyou also have elections around the corner, which becomes a bit of a volatile situation. Is there anything that we are looking\\nat it from a number standpoint, which made you use the word decisive?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe decisiveness is purely because the assets are coming to the end of life. And therefore, to ensure that the safety of the\\nemployees working and compliance to all the regulatory stuff, we need to come to a view. It has nothing to do with any\\nother extraneous factor. And when we talk about the asset, let me also be clear it is the heavy end assets, which are\\ncoming to an end of life. And we need to take actions as a responsible corporate on these assets. This is essentially the\\nreason.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nJust to add to the question on the BSPS charge out of the £200-odd million, which Koushik mentioned, there would be a\\ncorresponding deferred tax charge of around £50 million. So that's what you need to factor in.\\nOperator\\nWe would now like hand over the conference to Ms. Samita Shah for chat questions. Over to you ma'am\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThanks, Kinshuk. The first question is actually on the consolidated EBITDA. And can you please draw a bridge to Rs.\\n6,122 crores? This is, I think, really is coming from Tata Steel BlueScope and how do we kind of arrive at that number?\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. When we are looking at EBITDA, we are actually looking at it slightly differently from the way you do. We are really\\nlooking at total income and then excluding expenses, whereas I think when you are looking at it, you exclude other income,\\nand that is essentially the difference of what gives us Rs. 6,122 crores.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"We'll move to the next question. What is driving the higher sales realisation at TSLP? Is there any one-off in that?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nTSLP is, of course, benefiting a bit from the strong auto market because TSLP has a lot of products going to auto.\\n[inaudible]\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nWhat is the expected reduction in NRs in second quarter for India operations?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nWe said about Rs. 3,100 per ton QoQ reduction.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThis is on the Netherlands and the decarbonisation project. What sort of funding are we expecting from the government?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI think the conversation is still ongoing. It is too early to give a specific number. But I think what we also highlighted to the\\nNetherlands government is the kind of support that the other countries in Europe are providing to our peers. Whether it is\\nGermany, whether it's Spain, so the conversation is going on regarding fair level of funding, not only to support us in the\\ntransition, but also to make sure that we have a reasonably level playing field in Europe post the transition. I think that's\\nwhere we are. When we are closer to conclusion, we can share the details, but I must say that we've had very positive\\nconversations with the government. Of course, just now there's a change of political leadership, but we continue the\\nconversations with the senior bureaucrats in the Dutch government.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think this will take some time to crystallise. And I think because we will also have to come back with our capex estimation\\nof that transition, and we are just now starting to work on the technology partner as well as on the engineering and design\\nwork. It is a bit parallel conversation and that sign-off will happen. Potentially, it will take at least about a year or so to get\\ninto the final state. But there is work to be done, which is what we are doing. And the support, as I said, even in Netherlands,\\nit's a combination of policy support as well as funding support.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is TSUK. TSUK has been importing HRC from Tata Steel India. Are these imports being done to support\\nthe operation or to be sold in the local market or both? Do these imports fall under the UK steel safeguard quotas?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. The second answer is yes. It falls within the quotas, and we are complying with the quotas. But these exports to UK\\nare part of the downstream alignment, and we are not selling directly into the UK market. It is actually given as a substrate\\nto the UK downstream, for example, [inaudible] and then Tata Steel UK converts it and sells it to their customers\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Samita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on steel exports from India and how that is facing issues. What is the impact of higher Chinese\\nexports? Indian steel exports have been facing stiff competition from Asian origin be it China and Japan and the\\nVietnamese and Middle Eastern markets? Is this a cause of concern? And are you looking to explore new export markets?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nFor Tata Steel, exports have always been about 10%-15% of our production. Last quarter, I think we've exported 5% of\\nour production. We are not so dependent on exports to sell the volumes that we produce. But overall, yes, the Chinese\\nexports for most of the last quarter was at 8 million tons. For 2-3 months, it was at 8 million tons a month and above, which\\nis the highest that it has reached since 2016, because in 2016 - 17, it had gone to about 10 million tons a month, and that\\nis when there was a lot of noise against Chinese exports across the world. Since then, it was at about 5 - 6 million tons a\\nmonth level, which to me is a level which the world can live with. 8 million is certainly a cause of concern, but we believe\\nthat it's an outcome of Chinese steel producers producing more in the January-March quarter in anticipation of an economic\\nrecovery, which did not happen. And we are already seeing a tempering down of those sentiments and reflecting in the\\nproduction level. So, the latest info I have is the recent month, I think the exports is likely to be between 7 million and 8\\nmillion, and we expect that it will over the next few months come down to a 5 - 6 million levels because the Chinese\\ngovernment is also not encouraging exports as they did 5 - 7 years back, because today, they also have carbon reduction\\ntargets. I think the steel industry is being told that they don't want to be importing iron ore and coal, leave a carbon footprint\\nbehind and export a lot of low-value steel. I think there is a discipline, which will come in anyway, and we expect the second\\nhalf of the year to be more balanced. It will reflect both as a direct impact on Tata Steel because of the company’s exports\\nand includes an indirect impact because it will have an impact on the overall steel prices. I expect that if Chinese steel\\nexports come down, then hot-rolled coil prices should be more in the $600 - $650 per ton range rather than the current\\n$550 - $600 per ton range\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on capex. What are your capex plans for FY24 and FY25, a split between India and Europe? And on\\nKalinganagar, what is the remaining capex and total project cost? We don't give guidance for FY25, but maybe for FY24,\\nyou could give them some colour?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nFY24, we have already said Rs. 16,000 crores. And I think about Rs. 11,000 crores out of that were supposed to be for\\nIndia, if I remember right, largely Kalinganagar capex. Obviously, there is no constraint on supporting Kalinganagar capex.\\nSo as long as they can execute, as fast as they can execute and spend, the money will be given, and we budgeted for\\nwhatever is required by the project team. As Koushik mentioned, we've already spent about Rs. 18,000 crores on the\\nKalinganagar project. And as they require more funds, it will be made available. The focus is on executing the projects as\\nfast as possible.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on NINL. You had mentioned you would be expanding NINL. Can you please share some light on the\\ntimeline and the plans for NINL?\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Our first objective was to make sure that NINL is on full capacity and all the facilities in NINL, which were set up, but\\nhad never functioned or hardly functioned were back on track. I think we have fulfilled that objective within a year as we\\nhad wanted to. The last major facility, which will come on track is a coke plant, as Koushik said, in which already the\\nheating is going on and should start production by August. With that, we will be at an optimal production level and at an\\noptimal cost level in Neelachal. Iron ore mines are also operating and is feeding the requirements of Neelachal. I think, the\\nexisting network configuration infrastructure is being fully utilised.\\nNow comes to the next phase. We have the approval from our board to do the detail engineering in this Board meeting.\\nSo, we will now get into the detailed work. We already have worked out the configuration that we want to have to take it to\\nabout 4-4.5 million tons with the first phase of expansion. I think over the next 12 months or so, we will finalise the full\\ndetail and go to the Board because we have also changed the way we look at some of these approvals. We do the detailed\\nengineering, take it to an [inaudible] level of readiness before we go to the Board, so that as soon as we get the Board\\napproval, we also get all the environment clearances and everything else that's required, then we can hit the ground\\nrunning and actually reduce the cash-to-cash cycle. The work is going on in full speed and by next year, we should be\\nready to get the approvals and move on [inaudible].\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you. The next question is on iron ore. What would be our iron ore requirements by 2030? And how much of our iron\\nore capacity is coming up for re-auction?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo typically, requirement is 1.6 tons of iron ore per ton of steel. If you look at our plans for 2030, it's 40 million tons, let's\\nsay, 36 million tons out of that is blast furnace based. And say 3-4 million tons is EAF based. So basically, you do 1.6 into\\n36, you roughly have about 60 million or so. So that's the requirement, 60-65 million tons of iron ore. As I said, we already\\nhave with us reserves of 500 million tons of iron ore, 500-550 million tons of iron ore available beyond 2030. And some of\\nthese mines like the Gandhalpada mine was not a producing mine. It was a greenfield mine which we are developing. We\\nbid for that so that we could develop it in time for 2030. So just now, we will focus on the mines we have and places like\\nGandhalpada will start producing iron ore in 2030 and thereabouts. Between now and 2030, we want to obviously bid for\\nmore iron ore mines in Odisha and in Jharkhand when they put up for auctions. And then in addition, in 2030, we also\\nhave option to bid for our existing mines. Our objective is to make sure that we are fully covered for our iron ore\\nrequirements. By 2030, we will anyway be producing 60-65 million tons of iron ore to support our footprint. So basically,\\nself-sufficiency in iron ore is clearly there till 2030 and beyond 2030, we are expecting that we will be successful in our\\nbids for our mines and also the mines that we bid for between now and then, and we will be self-sufficient after 2030.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nAnd the question which we often get asked. In terms of inorganic growth, are we open to assets such as RINL, NMDC\\nsteel, or even Vedanta steel assets? And is this baked into our deleveraging target?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI think what we said is that our focus on inorganic growth over the last few years has now given us enough sites for us to\\nachieve our growth ambitions via pure organic growth. While we have set a target of 40 MTPA, the existing sites between\\nKalinganagar, the Bhushan site, Neelachal site, the existing Jamshedpur site, you can go up to 50 MTPA. In many ways,\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"our growth ambitions for the next decade can very easily be realised by making best use of existing sites and that will be\\nthe most cost optimal way because you are leveraging or better utilising the infrastructure that already exists or being\\ncreated in these sites. We don't really need to pursue inorganic growth to realise our growth ambitions. So that's why we\\nhave said that our priority is on organic growth, but at the same time, obviously, we will be watching carefully what is\\nhappening in the inorganic space.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you. Just before I go back to the audio questions, there was a question on working capital. As we had explained,\\nthere was a working capital increase of around Rs. 2,500 crores this quarter. This is more in terms of prices rather in terms\\nof days where they have been broadly stable. The overall consolidated number is about Rs. 24,000 crores, of which around\\nRs. 14,000 crores are in India.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Kirtan Mehta of BOB Caps.\\nKirtan Mehta, BOB Caps\\nIn relation to the iron ore mines, where we have 500 - 550 million tons of reserves potential, what is the current level of\\nproduction limit under the existing environmental clearances, and what are the additional environmental clearances that\\nwe have applied, which can enhance this limit? And what is the ultimate level at which this can ramp up by 2030?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo basically, Kirtan, the environment clearances are applied for when we need them. We typically plan the expansion of\\nour iron ore mines to be aligned with our increase in steel production. We have enough environment clearances to take\\ncare of Kalinganagar, let's say, moving from 3 to 8 MTPA. Last year, we produced over 38 million tons of iron ore. We will\\nmove on to about 45 - 50 million tons over the next few years as our steel requirements, steel capacity or production keeps\\ngoing up. So that's not a bottleneck. I think we planned it well so that we have all the environment clearances in place.\\nAnd like I said, our goal is not to have to buy any iron ore from the market or any pellets from the market. We had to do it\\nover the last 2-3 years sometimes simply because of inorganic growth, we grew faster than we had planned. The iron ore\\nexpansion was planned to cater to the Kalinganagar expansion. But once we acquired Bhushan and once, we acquired\\nNeelachal, and the Usha Martin facility, we had to obviously use some of our iron ore for those facilities. So, there was a\\nbit of a lag, but now we are back on track. And if you are going to do only organic growth, then it is much easier for us to\\nmanage the iron ore requirement.\\nKirtan Mehta, BOB Caps\\nSecond question was on Europe side, where we have said that over the next 2 - 3 years, the Netherlands would be EBITDA\\npositive as well as cash flow positive. In the past, we have not really shared what the Netherlands individually makes. Is it\\npossible to share the average EBITDA that they've made over the cycle over the last 6 - 7 years, and the average cash\\nthat Netherlands facility has normally generated?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nWe used to manage and run Tata Steel Europe as one entity. But if I can give you a range, the Netherlands EBITDA per\\nton range has been between €70 per ton to about €140 per ton. In FY22 context, it was much higher. Typically, Netherlands\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"has been free cash flow positive about €200 million or thereabouts on an average basis. And as I said, that in FY22, it had\\ngenerated more than €500 million of free cash. That's why the point that Naren mentioned that over years, it has normally\\nbeen positive PAT and positive free cash flow, not only EBITDA. And our expectation is that post relining when the steady\\nstate reaches, it would continue with its past performance. There's nothing that needs to be done. What needs to be done\\nis to ensure that it is future ready in terms of its cost structure towards the decarbonisation. And that's a special initiative\\nthat all our colleagues in Netherlands are working towards.\\nOperator\\nThank you very much. That was the last question for today. I would now like to hand the conference back to Ms. Samita\\nShah for closing comments. Over to you, ma'am.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you, Kinshuk.

Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to this call to discuss our results for the second quarter of\\nFY2024. We published our results yesterday, and there was a detailed presentation explaining the same uploaded on our\\nwebsite. I hope you had a chance to go through it. We had quite a few announcements also with the results, and we would\\nbe happy to share the details and provide any clarifications you may require. We will be joined on this call by our CEO and\\nMD, Mr. T. V. Narendran; and our ED and CFO, Mr. Koushik Chatterjee. Before I hand it over to them, I would like to\\nremind you that this entire conversation today will be covered by the safe harbour clause on Page 2 of our presentation\\nThank you, and over to you, Naren.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nGood afternoon, good morning, or good evening, depending on where you are. Thank you for joining the call. I'm going to\\nmake a few comments and then hand over to Koushik.\\nTata Steel, as you know, is focused on creating sustainable value and our strategic priorities embodies our commitment\\nto responsible growth while creating an equitable share and prosperous future for all. We continue to make steady progress\\non this value creation journey, leveraging digitisation and an agile business model.\\nDuring the quarter, steel prices across regions moderated on slowdown in economic activity. In the US and EU, elevated\\ninterest rates to manage inflation adversely affected demand, while in China, persistent weakness in the property market\\ncontinued to be an overhang on the prices. In India, the steel prices were impacted by the global sentiment, but given the\\nresilient demand, it witnessed a lower drop in prices of 3% QoQ than the rest of the key markets. As a result, our net\\nrealisations in India declined by about Rs. 2,400 per ton on QoQ basis. We had guided about Rs. 3,000 per ton, so it is\\nslightly better than that.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Moving to our performance. India crude steel production was around 5 million tons. Production was broadly stable on QoQ\\nbasis, but up 5% on YoY basis. India deliveries grew by about 6% YoY and have been close to 5 million tons in the last 3\\nquarters. Amongst the segments, the Automotive segment had the best ever 2Q sales and was up 7% QoQ. We have\\nstarted producing full hard cold rolled coils at the Kalinganagar cold rolling mill and have started receiving approvals from\\nthe automotive OEMs for cold rolled steel from Kalinganagar. Our retail sales primarily to homebuilders have continued to\\ngrow and have crossed 3 million tons in the last 12 months. Our well-established brands, such as Tata Tiscon, Tata\\nSteelium and Tata Astrum, had best ever 2Q sales and revenues from Tata Steel Aashiyana, the e-commerce platform for\\nindividual homebuilders, witnessed an increase of more than 70% on QoQ basis. In the last 12 months, Tata Steel\\nAashiyana revenues have exceeded Rs. 1,700 crores.\\nIn Europe, steel deliveries were around 1.8 million tons in the second quarter on subdued demand and the revenue per\\nton was down about £50 - 60 per ton in UK and Netherlands on QoQ basis. This has weighed on performance in both the\\ngeographies. The ongoing reline of one of the blast furnaces at Ijmuiden in Netherlands, which accounts for 40% of our\\nproduction there, has also impacted the Tata Steel Netherlands realisation because of the adverse product mix and other\\nexpenses. The relining is expected to be completed in the third quarter of FY24, which is this quarter.\\nIn terms of growth, multiple projects are underway across India, ranging from the 5 MTPA expansion at Kalinganagar as\\nwell as growth in the downstream portfolio. The downstream portfolio, which consists of our tubes business, our wires\\nbusiness, our packaging or tinplate business, and the DI pipes business is expected to grow from about 2 million tons to\\n7 million tons, which enables better product mix enrichment. We recently had the ground-breaking ceremony for the 0.75\\nMTPA EAF project at Ludhiana and are targeting to start the plant in 2026.\\nWe are committed to achieve net zero by 2045 and are pursuing decarbonization of operations in a phased manner,\\ncalibrated to the regulatory framework, resources, government support and customers in each of the geographies that we\\nare in. Accordingly, in September, we announced a proposed plan to invest in a state-of-the-art scrap based EAF at Port\\nTalbot, UK at a cost of £1.25 billion with a government grant of £500 million. This is subject to relevant regulatory approvals,\\ninformation and consultation process and finalization of detailed terms and conditions. The transition to EAF-based\\nsteelmaking will result in the reduction of about 50 million tons of direct carbon emissions over a decade. There will also\\nbe impairment and restructuring costs, which Koushik will explain in more detail. Tata Steel Netherlands has been working\\nintensely with the Government of Netherlands on the contours of decarbonization project covering emissions and health\\nstandards. Tata Steel Netherlands will shortly be submitting the detailed decarbonization proposal to the Government of\\nNetherlands seeking regulatory and financial support, which is critical to build a long-term and strong business case. The\\nBoard of Tata Steel will duly consider the project for approval at an appropriate time. In India, we are entering into an\\nagreement to source about 379 MW of renewable power for our operations, which will enable a reduction of 50 million tons\\nof carbon emissions over the next 25 years. This will significantly reduce our dependence on coal-based power plants.\\nLooking ahead, in India, net realizations are expected to improve by about Rs. 2,200 per ton QoQ, aided by domestic\\ndemand, which has shown great resilience despite the renewed volatility in the global sentiment. The coking coal\\nconsumption cost is likely to increase by about $10 per ton QoQ. In UK and Netherlands, the improvement in costs is likely\\nto offset the drop in NRs and drive an improvement in the performance on QoQ basis. I am happy to share that Tata Steel\\nhas received the Safety and Health Excellence recognition for 2023 by worldsteel. We were recognized for our innovative\\napproach to real-time visualisation of risk movement that aims to provide real-time insights and alerts. These initiatives\\ndisplay our commitment to achieve zero harm. Thank you. And over to Koushik.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThank you, Naren. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to all those who have joined in. I will begin with the\\nquarterly performance provided on Slide 25. Our consolidated revenue stood at Rs. 55,682 crores, and the consolidated\\nEBITDA was Rs. 4,315 crores, which translates to an EBITDA margin of about 8%. Standalone performance was broadly\\nstable, but the UK and the Netherlands performance has been adversely impacted during this quarter.\\nBefore we get into the numbers, I would like to mention that we have received sanctions for the amalgamation of Tata\\nSteel Long Products (i.e. TSLP), and Tata Steel Mining with Tata Steel Limited. Accordingly, the Standalone financial\\nstatements have been restated from 1 st April 2022 to reflect the merger. With this, the merger process for 2 entities has\\nbeen largely completed, and the other 5 are in progress as highlighted on Slide 20. This portfolio simplification process\\nwill drive efficiencies and prevent value leakages.\\nFor the quarter, Tata Steel Standalone EBITDA stood at about Rs. 6,917 crores, which translates to an EBITDA per ton of\\nabout Rs. 14,365. Excluding forex gain of about Rs. 464 crores, EBITDA margin was broadly stable at about 19% on QoQ\\nbasis. As provided on Slide 31, the drop in steel realisations was offset by lower cost. Standalone NRs declined by about\\nRs. 2,400 per ton on QoQ basis due to market dynamics and seasonal factors. Within costs, the coking coal consumption\\ncost was down by about $59 per ton on QoQ basis, and the conversion costs were down by about Rs 2,600 per ton QoQ.\\nOur conversion costs have been fairly stable over the last 3 years despite the inflationary pressures in the economy.\\nAt Tata Steel UK, the EBITDA loss was about £132 million compared to a loss of £41 million tons in 1QFY2024. On a per\\nton basis, EBITDA moved lower by about £127 per ton QoQ. As shown on Slide 34, the steel production was lower due to\\noperational issues and the shutdown of the sinter plant. This has weighed on the cost profile of the operations and led to\\nelevated costs, which offset the decline in the coking coal consumption cost and natural gas spend. Coupled with drop in\\nrealisations, this has resulted in lower spreads on QoQ basis.\\nIn Tata Steel Netherlands, the EBITDA loss stood at about £110 million compared to £114 million in 1Q. As shown on the\\nSlide 33. The drop in realisations was offset by the improvement in costs. Revenue decreased by about £60 per ton on\\nsubdued demand but was fully offset by lower raw material costs on decline of coking coal consumption cost and lower\\nconversion costs primarily on decline in the natural gas spend, along with reduced repairs and maintenance costs. Looking\\nahead, the completion of BF6 in the third quarter, which is this quarter, should drive the liquid steel production and further\\nimprovements in the product mix and cost. As previously explained, we have hedges in place for energy at both UK and\\nNetherlands and the drop in spot natural gas prices has reflected in the 2Q P&L with a lag.\\nI would now like to brief you about Tata Steel UK developments to supplement what Naren has said. Subsequent to the\\nannouncement of the agreement with the UK government for the decarbonisation project in September, we are in\\ndiscussions and consultation with the union and the employee representatives in the UK in relation to the restructuring of\\nthe business, its configuration within the transition time and the eventual investment towards decarbonisation. The\\nrestructuring and the transition would commence after this consultation. Given our proposed plan to change the business\\nmodel and the route for steelmaking, the existing heavy end assets at TSUK can only be used for a defined period.\\nAccordingly, we have taken an impairment charge against the investments in the standalone financial statements in relation\\nto the UK business. We have also recorded an impairment of assets and provisions for potential restructuring, closure,\\nand redundancy costs in the consolidated financial statements in relation to the UK business. The impairment charge in\\nTata Steel Standalone is Rs. 12,961 crores and the charge in the consolidated books is about Rs. 3,255 crores. Let me\\nexplain the difference. In standalone, the discounted cash flow value of every business is compared to the net carrying\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"value of the investment made in that business. A deficit in that leads to impairment. Such impairment in standalone gets\\nreversed in the consolidated statement. In the consolidated financial statement, the discounted cash flow of the individual\\nbusinesses is compared to the carrying value of the plant and equipment and the fixed assets. In the above case, the\\ncarrying value in standalone was higher than the consolidated business, and that is why this difference.\\nMoving to taxes, there was a sharp drop this quarter. The current tax was about Rs. 1,105 crores and broadly in line with\\nthe tax on the profitability of the India operations. The deferred tax credit of Rs. 1,333 crores has been driven by the merger\\nand completion of the British Steel Pension Scheme. Taxes should get normalized post all these mergers. The deferred\\ntax includes credits on account of TSLP and the merger on mining. And there are other tax adjustments, which we can\\nexplain to you offline.\\nMoving to the cash flows. The operating cash flow for the quarter stood at about Rs. 4,658 crores and in part was driven\\nby the favourable working capital movement. In the second quarter, there was a working capital release driven by the fall\\nin the coking coal inventory volumes of around 200,000 tons and a drop in steel prices and reduction in debtors. We spent\\nabout Rs. 4,553 crores in capital expenditure during the quarter and about Rs. 8,642 crores in the first half, as we keep\\nprioritising growth in India, including expansion of the downstream portfolio across wires, tubes, ductile iron pipe and\\ntinplate businesses. Overall, the operating performance at Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK, higher capex and\\ndividend payout have led to a decline in the cash and cash equivalent by about Rs. 6,352 crores. As a result, the gross\\ndebt has remained stable on QoQ basis, but the net debt has increased by about Rs. 5,600 crores. Our finance costs are\\nbroadly stable on a QoQ basis. The group liquidity remains strong at about Rs. 27,637 crores, including about Rs. 12,691\\ncrores of cash and cash equivalents. As you are aware, Moody's upgraded our credit trading to investment grade in the\\nmonth of September 2023. Thank you, and over to the floor for Q&A.\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\\nOperator\\nThe first question is from Sumangal Nevatia of Kotak Securities.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nThe first question is with respect to the developments in the UK. One is we have taken restructuring provisions, but what\\nis the status of the discussion with employees? And when is it likely to conclude? Also just want to understand, over the 3\\nyears when the construction of the new plant will happen, in the previous discussions, we shared that we would look to\\nuse the downstream assets of UK. What sort of volume and EBITDA of just rolling do we expect over the interim period?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSumangal, the first is, as we mentioned in a pretty detailed manner in our release yesterday, the conversation and the\\nconsultation process has started ever since our announcement on 15th September. There is a proper process that we have\\nto follow, which is stipulated legally. And we are doing that, and we will do that. It is a meaningful consultation. We will\\nobviously, as a responsible corporate, continue to hear their point of view or any other suggestions or advice or any point\\nthat they may have on our proposal. And once we have looked at it over the next couple of weeks, we will certainly progress\\non this conversation. I can say that this is progressing as per plan. It is dealing with a very sensitive subject, and we are\\nmindful about that. But it is also about getting the investment process in place. So, we continue to engage with the unions,\\nand we continue to do so until it gets formally completed. The formal process takes about 45 days at the minimum as per\\nlegal requirements, but that formal process starts after a certain period. [inaudible] The informal process continues and\\ngive opportunities to both sides to explain positions. We have also had detailed engagement with the advisors of the unions\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"and have shown them the counterfactual positions and our issues in sustaining the business in its current vulnerable form\\nand also the operational risk and the market risk that we face. It is a very intense and an exhaustive process, which we\\nare currently in. Then we hope to complete as per the timeline that we have set for ourselves.\\nAs far as the transition period, yes, you are right. As per the proposal that we have agreed with the government and the\\nproposal that we've put forth to the unions, it is important for us to continue to ensure market protection and for which we\\nwill continue to focus on ensuring a stable supply chain to run the downstream unit. The volume should be in the ballpark\\nof 2.5 - 2.6 million tons. But more details on this, I would be in a better position to give once the consultation gets over and\\nensure that we have tied up all the ends as far as sourcing, production, and all of that is concerned. I think it will be a good\\ntime to talk about it in the next earnings call rather than now.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nUnderstood. That's very helpful. Second question, continuing on the Europe division. The losses in both regions are\\nincreasing. So one is, if you could just share some outlook on margins maybe next quarter and also over the next 2 - 3\\nquarters? How should it shape up after relining? And is the relining also getting a bit extended into 3Q?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Sumangal, I think on Netherlands, yes, the blast furnace relining has extended to this quarter. As Koushik mentioned,\\nwe are expecting that, by the end of November, latest by the first week of December, we will have the blast furnace up\\nand running. We expect the numbers of [inaudible] Netherlands to be better than last quarter, but we expect it to be EBITDA\\npositive only from next quarter, which is 4QFY24. So, there are a few things. Obviously, the blast furnace, which is down,\\naccounts for 40% of our volume. So, you are carrying fixed costs with 60% of the volume. So that has an impact, which is\\nseen. Secondly, as we mentioned last time, we work on a forward hedge on gas prices, etc. So, our energy cost, gas\\nprices in the second half should be lower than what it was in the first half in Netherlands. That should help. Volumes should\\nbe better. The costs should also be better. Of course, the spot spreads are a concern in Europe just now, but we expect\\nthat given the current levels, as you know, in Europe, some of the producers have already put down blast furnaces, so\\nthere will be a better balance between demand and supply. Either coking coal prices have to come down or steel prices\\nhave to go up. That's what we expect to happen in 4Q.\\nSumangal Nevatia, Kotak Securities:\\nUnderstood, and the UK existing furnace, which quarter do we mothball it? Do we run it entirely in the second half?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSumangal, I think a safe thing to say is that we will run it fully in this quarter, which is the third quarter. And post consultation,\\nI think we will be in a better position to tell you when and how we are going to deal with the heavy end, and that would be\\na better way [inaudible]. But I think that in the transition period, as I said, we will continue to operate downstream facilities.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Tarang Agarwal of OldBridge Capital.\\nTarang Agarwal, OldBridge Capital\\nA couple of questions from me. One on Netherlands. What is the sustainability capex outlay that you are looking at? And\\nwould you expect a similar support that we’ve seen for some of the other European governments that have extended to\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"your peers. The second is on UK. If you could give us the net cash outflow and the timing of these cash flows as the\\ntransition plan starts. How is it going to be staggered over the next 3 year period? And what is the quantum of it? My sense\\nis, as there will be settlements, there will be capex, but you will have a reduced maintenance capex also.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nThanks, Tarang. I'll let Koushik answer the second one. On the first one, we don't want to give you specific numbers now,\\nbut I'll give you a few principles. I think in Europe, when any steel producer is making submissions to government, I think\\nthe ask is 40% to 60% of the capex that is required for the transition. That is one. Secondly, on opex, it depends on the\\ncountry and the advantages or disadvantages that the country has. It is more a question of creating a level playing field\\nbecause different countries are giving different supports to the company. You don't want to end up at the other end of the\\ntransition at an operational disadvantage compared to where your peers are. These are the 2 principles on which the ask\\nis curated. The specific amounts, we will not want to discuss just now simply because there is a conversation going on\\nwith the government. And once it is more definite and we have discussed with our Board, the proposal in its entirety, we\\nwill come back. But the principle is this.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. On the second part of the question, which is on the cash outflows. The project cash outflow is about £1.25 billion, of\\nwhich £750 million will be borne by Tata Steel, and about £500 will be grant from the UK government. That spend will start\\nmore around the second half of FY25 because we are currently in the detailed engineering phase. And this engineering\\nwork takes about 5 months or so. And once that is completed, then the grant agreement becomes effective and then we\\nstart spending the money. The initial spend is obviously done by Tata Steel, but that money comes in arrears of a quarter,\\netc., and it will go almost hand in hand. So that £750 million follows typically how a normal organic growth project is, which\\nis over a 4-year period and the last 20% is after commissioning. That is how the thumb rule is. I think that is how we should\\ntake it. In the meanwhile, the restructuring cost is obviously more front-loaded than the capex spends, and the restructuring\\ncost will be spent in the first half of the financial year FY25. The amount of that restructuring will be negotiated or agreed\\nupon, especially in relation to what relates to employee impact during the consultation phase. We would not want to talk\\nabout it because it is commercially sensitive at this point of time. And we will obviously have to discuss the specifics of it.\\nWe know the numbers in our head, but I think commercially, it would be important to talk once the consultation is over.\\nTarang Agarwal, OldBridge Capital\\nI understand. Sir, would this also entail reduction in your current capital outlay for the Port Talbot capacity because\\nessentially, a part of the capacity will be mothballed, right? To that extent, you should see some savings on maintenance\\ncapex, per se?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe total capex for Port Talbot used to be typically around £80 - 90 million a year. [inaudible] in future years or during\\ntransition, the investment in our mind is only on the downstream, which is pretty small compared to the heavy end. The\\ncategory 1 and category 2 capex for the heavy, which is essentially for license to operate & safety and ensuring the quality\\nor the condition of the assets so they can continue to operate as we are in consultation. Beyond that, big investments on\\nthe current assets are not in place.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nAlso, I think there will be a saving on the maintenance opex because there is a significant maintenance opex currently,\\nwhich goes in UK for the heavy end.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThat's correct.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Satyadeep Jain of Ambit Capital.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit Capital\\nJust switching gears to India for a bit. Just wanted to know what is the progress on KPO-2? Is it on time and budget?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. I think what we mentioned, the pellet plant is already operating. One line is pulled out. The second line will start this\\nmonth. So, the pellet plant and cold rolling mill are operational. These are the 2 that we prioritised. The FHCR that we\\nmake out of the cold rolling mill is already getting approved by automotive customers after we have annealed it in\\nJamshedpur and sent it. The blast furnace should start in the next 6 months or so. In fact, earlier the better, but we are\\nbasically targeting that in the next 6 months we will start the blast furnace. We are also starting the second caster in the\\nsteel melt shop this quarter and that will give us some additional volume because with the existing blast furnace, we can\\nproduce a little bit more. I think one by one, all the facilities are coming on stream. The coke ovens will start, then you will\\nhave the third caster in the steel melt shop coming on etc. and the galvanizing lines and the annealing lines in Kalinganagar\\nare also coming on next year. So, in the next financial year you will see most of the critical facilities being commissioned\\nin different stages of ramp-up.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit Capital\\nOkay. Secondly, coming back to Europe, you mentioned that you will finalise the numbers and operating drivers during\\nthe transition period in the next quarter. Broadly, do you expect to be cash breakeven at least during the transition period?\\nAlso, you have taken writedown based on comparing DCF with the carrying value. Given the life of Netherlands is also\\nanother 6 - 7 years and maybe your discounted value is higher right now, if you have to take a look at impairment, have\\nyou taken full impairment of heavy end assets in UK, which means have they been written down to zero? And what kind\\nof potential writedown be there in the next couple of years or so in any other asset?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nSatyadeep, I think as far as the UK is concerned, this is a definitive play. Once you sign a term sheet with the government,\\nproviders of capital and then it is the procedures to move on. I think the upstream gets very much defined in terms of its\\noperational longevity, certainly financial longevity. And that is the basis on which we have taken the entire writedown of\\nthe upstream as part of this impairment that you see, which is both the asset side and obviously, from the investment side\\nin the standalone. In Netherlands, we are not in that state at this point of time. In fact, as Naren mentioned in the early\\npart, we are relining the blast furnace. That is a renewal of life as far as BF6 is concerned. In Netherlands, the pace of\\ndecarbonisation project is high, but in terms of timeline it’s behind the UK at this point of time. Therefore, once the transition\\nplan is finalized and once the transition configuration is finalized, that is the time when we will keep doing the assessment,\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"and hopefully, we will be able because Netherlands is fundamentally more profitable. So, its ability to have a more\\neconomically stable transition is much higher than in the UK because these assets in the UK have been lagging in their\\nability to generate cash flows for some time. So I think Netherlands and UK are in different stages at this point of time. We\\nwill be looking at the feedback from the government. And as we continue to engage with them very intensely, understand\\nthe pace and the flow of the transition, come back to the Board and then we will know how the pacing will work. It is slightly\\ndifferent in Netherlands compared to the UK and Netherlands also has a very rich downstream asset portfolio, which is\\nlinked. And with the new blast furnace coming in, it is a slightly different story.\\nSatyadeep Jain, Ambit Capital\\nJust a clarification on that cash flow during transition period, just broadly, do you expect it to be cash flow positive?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Sorry, you asked that question. I think, yes, broadly, based on our assumptions, the way we've been planning is that\\nthis business has to sustain during the transition. Our assumption is that we would be sourcing, converting, taking out\\ncosts in a manner such that it is very lean during the transition and hence be neutral on its cash flows other than the oneoffs, which is the restructuring cost and the project cost.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Kirtan Mehta of BOB Caps.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nOne question as a follow-up on the UK transition cost. With the shutdown of the blast furnace in the Netherlands, we are\\ncurrently running in a slab to rolling mode. What would be the gross spread that we are currently earning there. As of now,\\nit is not sufficient to cover the high associated fixed cost. That is the reason we are running into the losses. But how does\\nthat gross spread compare with the UK when we operate only in the slab mode?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is a spot spread and there is a felt spread. The felt spread is around €240 per ton. The spot spreads are very much\\nlower than that. That's because the coking coal prices are high, and the steel prices are low. But the spread at which we\\noperate is around €240 – 250/t. We are making a loss in Netherlands because obviously, when you run at 60% capacity,\\nthe fixed costs get distributed over smaller volumes and at €240/t, you cannot be making money. As far as UK is concerned,\\nI think the larger point which Koushik is making is, obviously, this is all subject to consultations and where we end with the\\nunions. But broadly, the plan is whatever we do, how we can do the transition in a cash neutral or cash positive way. I\\nthink that's primarily the objective, whether it is slabs or coils or whatever it is that we bring in because there are 2 - 3\\nobjectives of the transition. One is how can we be cash neutral or cash positive? Two is how can we keep the downstream\\nunits running because that also has an impact. 50% of the workforce in the UK is in the downstream units. And the third\\nand most important is how do we make sure that our customers are serviced.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nJust one clarification. €240 per ton spread, when we are talking about, is it the integrated spread. If we are not having a\\nblast furnace and operating only on slab, then what would be the conversion spread that we earn from slab in the\\nNetherlands currently? Would we have any idea about that number?\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I don't know if Koushik wants to answer that. But broadly, the slabs that we used, honestly, are high-cost slabs, which\\nwe produced last year and kept in stock in anticipation of the reline. So that is part of the reason why we have a negative\\nEBITDA, or we've had NRV losses in the last 2 - 3 quarters. You had to produce slabs when you could, and that was last\\nyear when gas prices and everything else was at its highest level. We built slab stocks of about 7,00,000 tons before the\\nblast furnace reline. Now we have drawn down stocks that will translate into working capital release, but they were all highcost slabs and also contributed to the financial performance of Netherlands over the last few years. But typically, slab hot\\nrolled coil gaps are not so great and nobody in Europe on an ongoing basis, be looking at bringing slabs and making hot\\nrolled coils and sell. And a lot of our hot rolled coils are also sold to customers who seek approvals, etc. So that's more a\\ntemporary situation than something that we look for as a long-term solution. Koushik, I don't know if you want to add more\\ncolour to it.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nI was just guessing the answer that you are trying to get is, in a European situation, if purchased raw materials in an\\nintegrated basis, the average EBITDA percentage is about 6 - 8%. In case of a conversion model, that falls down to\\nsomewhere around 3%. So, I think that is broadly the way in which it works.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nUnderstood, sir. And just one more clarification. I think you mentioned in the opening remarks about the coking coal\\nreduction or the coking coal cost increase that we can see in quarter 3, I missed that number. Would you be able to sort\\nof indicate that number again?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nIt is different in different operating units. In India, 3Q is going to be about $10 - 11 per ton higher than 2Q. In Netherlands,\\nit's going to be about $60 - 65 per ton lower. I'm talking of consumption, because in Netherlands, last quarter, a lot of\\nhigher cost coal was used. And in UK, I think it is going to be about $20 per ton lower in 3Q compared to 2Q.\\nKirtan Mehta, BoB Capital\\nGreat. Against that $100 increase that we are seeing in the coking coal prices in India, we are only anticipating increase\\nof $10 – 11. Are we benefiting from availability of the higher inventory of coking coal in India operations?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nNo. I mean, basically, you're using the coking coal that you bought last quarter. So last quarter, the prices were dropping\\nuntil September, then it started going up from September. Typically, you will get the coking coal 2 - 3 months after you buy\\nit, or you contract it. That is what comes into the consumption. You had a higher reduction. I think we had a $60 reduction\\nin 2Q compared to 1Q, and we have $11 increase in 3Q compared to 2Q. And the reverse is true in Netherlands where\\nwe consumed some of the higher cost coal, so we had only a $7 reduction in 2Q compared to 1Q, but we have a $60\\nreduction in 3Q compared to 2Q. So, it's basically the inventory flowing through.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt is a lag effect.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Operator\\nThe next question is from Ashish Jain from Macquarie.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nMy first question is, in the UK, this provision that we have taken off for roughly Rs. 2,425 crores, does that include some\\nprovision towards the onetime cost that you might incur related to employees? Is that the right way to understand?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere are 2 elements in the provisions that we have taken in the UK. The first one is in relation to the PP&E, which is in\\nrelation to the way in which impairment is taken. The second provision is in relation to potential [inaudible] obligations\\ntriggering out of the redundancies & closures and restructuring costs. Both have been taken.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nRight. My focus is that Rs. [inaudible] crores number, that is our current assessment or best case judgment of what the\\nonetime employee-related cost could be? Is that the right way to think?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt has got multiple elements in that. It is a broad bracket of restructuring. It has got potentially a closure or a restructuring,\\nif there is a contract termination, [inaudible] there is a people number. It is a basket of provisions.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nSir, secondly, we spoke about where our costs might go down in the UK in terms of lower maintenance and all, which is\\nwell understood. But let's assume this employee negotiation gets over in 1Q next calendar year. Shall we also assume\\nthat whatever the redundancy is, the cost related to that also goes out from 2Q itself and hence, our fixed costs will decline\\nsharply in UK. Is that the way to think?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIt is a sensitive subject to talk about just now before we complete the consultation because it also involves the nature of\\npeople being impacted in the context that there is a phasing that may happen based on our proposal at this point of time\\nwith pre-consultation and post-consultation. But normally, what happens is, it's not a switch off. It is a phasing. These costs\\nwill be incurred over maybe 2 - 3 quarters in a proportionately sliding scale basis based on the numbers that we agree etc.\\nThe provision that has been taken is on a gross basis. And as and when the restructuring is agreed upon or negotiated\\nwith the unions, the cash outgo will happen. Bulk of the cash outgo will be in the first half of FY2025.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nKoushik, sorry, to harp on this, but just to clarify, maybe bulk of the onetime outgo happens in first half next year? Or\\nwhatever be the time frame. But whenever that happens from that shall we assume the fixed cost will decline? The reason\\nI'm asking is because if I take a 24 - 36-month time frame, where we will be importing steel and servicing the UK market,\\nif the fixed cost does not come down from day 1 or day 2, would it be a continuous drag on cash flows in the UK?\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Ashish, your understanding is absolutely correct. The whole focus of this whole restructuring, reinvestment, or the\\ntransition period, as both Naren and I have mentioned, is to run the business in transition, which does not drag on cash\\nflows. So therefore, fixed cost is a very important part because once you don't have the heavy end, which is the bleed end\\nof Port Talbot, then you would certainly reduce the fixed cost in one go, but the effect of that takes two quarters. But\\nwhenever it happens, it will certainly come down very sharply across the organization. And therefore, that is how it will\\nsustain itself. As I mentioned a while back, because your fundamental EBITDA spreads also come down. And in that, if\\nyou have to make profits or cash flows, you have to ensure that your entire fixed cost overheads, everything runs very,\\nvery tightly.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nRight. Right. And just my second question, it's a very small question. If I extend the current spreads in Netherlands to 4Q,\\nwhen we become fully operational and our maintenance and all will be behind us. On current spread basis, we would be\\nmaking losses in 4Q also, I guess, right?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNot at the EBITDA level. We will be EBITDA positive.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Amit Dixit ICICI Securities.\\nAmit Dixit, ICICI Securities\\nI have a couple of questions. The first one is, essentially, if you could bridge the gap between TSE EBITDA for last quarter\\nand this quarter in 3 buckets - realisations, coking coal and relining costs, that would be great. That is the first question I\\nhave? So for example - from $96 to $170/t. What is the bridge? How do we break it into 3 buckets - realisations decline,\\ncoking coal cost and relining cost?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI'll give you 2 of the 3. We'll think of the third one. On the realisation, 2Q over 1Q for Netherlands was down £61 per ton.\\nAs far as coking coal is concerned, it was down $7 per ton. Relining basically, the impact is volumes. I think we had slightly\\nmore volume in 2Q because maybe we sold more. But production wise, not so much difference between 1Q and 2Q. But\\nboth 1Q and 2Q were bad because you were only operating one blast furnace. So, cost gets distributed over lower volumes.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nTo substantiate, the volume impact between 1Q and 2Q, we have sold about 1,00,000 tons lower in 2Q compared to 1Q.\\nThe realisations, as Naren mentioned, was about €60 per ton lower QoQ. And then there were other costs [inaudible] gas\\nprices and energy prices were also lower. Repair and maintenance prices were slightly lower. So that's broadly the bridge\\nthat we have. There were no one-offs included in this.\\nAmit Dixit, ICICI Securities\\nThe second question is essentially on net debt. While we have seen net debt going up this quarter despite the operating\\ncash flow being almost at par with capex. Now going ahead, the performance is going to improve in India as well as in\\nEurope. Is this the peak net debt level that we are seeing for the current year and for next 3 - 4 quarters, maybe?\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Koushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nFor the next 2 quarters, I would say that the assumption that the Netherlands comes back in the way that we are planning,\\nthe net debt number should be around this. There could be plus and minuses. We will certainly want to reduce net debt\\nfrom where we are. But given the market conditions, especially internationally and depending on where the restructuring\\nexpenses are when it is going out, I think it is broadly in this range. It will be for the next 2 quarters. But our long-term goal\\nof reducing net debt remains. We've been pushed back by certain events and circumstances in the market, but I think we\\nwill continue to focus on reducing the net debt from where we are.\\nAmit Dixit, ICICI Securities\\nBut [inaudible] of restructuring and ex of capex, whatever we will incur at TSUK, I think it is safe to assume that given the\\nmarket conditions, net debt level should come down from here?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThat is correct. That’s what we are saying.\\nAmit Dixit, ICICI Securities\\nAnd last one, if I may. If you can explain the BSPS related provision in the notes and is there a cash outflow also associated\\nwith it? Because we thought that BSPS step is over, but suddenly, we saw this provision again.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nNo. So this is not a provision as such. BSPS was sitting in our books, and we closed the buy-in in the first quarter. Post\\nthe buy-in getting completed, there was a certain amount of surplus, which actually belongs to the members. As part of\\ntaking it out of the balance sheet effectively, that surplus is the one which has gone in. It is not a provision. That surplus\\nwas at some point in time credited to the balance sheet, so now it has gone away from the balance sheet, and there was\\na deferred tax impact on account of that. There is no cash outgo. The BSPS is a done story at this point of time. In 1Q, the\\nbuy-in was completed. Now the separation has been completed in some ways.\\nOperator\\nThe next question is from Ashish Jain Macquarie\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nMy question is on India growth plans. I think you clarified that the Kalinganagar 5 mn ton will come in next 6 months or so?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD – Tata Steel Limited\\nI said the blast furnace will start and will ramp up. You would see next year as a year of ramp-up of Kalinganagar.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nRight. So, sir, what are we planning in terms of our next phase of growth because we have a well laid out plan in terms of\\nwhere we want to be in FY30 in terms of domestic capacity. What is the thought process in terms of when do we take up\\nthe next phase of expansion because there is a 3 – 4 year time frame for that?\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD – Tata Steel Limited\\nSure. One is the ongoing projects, like I said, Kalinganagar and the Ludhiana EAF project, for which the ground-breaking\\nhas just been done. And in the next 2 years, we should have that capacity up, that's 0.75 MTPA. These are clear cut for\\nthe next 2 years. Over the next 6 months, we would be finalizing the plans for Neelachal expansion and also working on\\nthe Kalinganagar Phase 3. In terms of opportunity, we can grow Neelachal from ~1 million to 5 million over the next few\\nyears and the plans are being developed. It will be taken to the Board in the next few months. We have an opportunity to\\ntake Kalinganagar from 8 to 13 million tons. As we finish this expansion, you can move seamlessly into the next phase.\\nAnd there is the Bhushan plant in Meramandali, which can go from 5 to 6.5 million tons in the first phase and from 6.5 to\\n10 mn tons in the second phase, which we will need a little bit more land in the surrounding areas. If you look at Bhushan\\ngoing to 6.5, Kalinganagar going to 13, Neelachal going to 5 mn tons. You're already at about 25 mn tons. Jamshedpur is\\nalready at 11 mn tons. So, you have 36 mn tons. You have at least 1 EAF, which is Ludhiana, so you are pretty close to\\n37 mn tons. And beyond that to 40 MTPA, you have an option of scaling up other EAFs. We are already looking at South\\nas the next location.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nSir, I understand the road map and all because we have been talking about it. My point was more like why are we delaying\\ntaking up the expansion? Are we going slow because of our balance sheet focus? Because if I compare with what our\\npeers are doing in terms of expansion, at least at this moment, they seem to be a bit more aggressive or ahead of time.\\nAnd especially given the India growth story and the volume expectation and all, do we think that we are running the risk of\\nlosing market share from a capacity point of view?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD – Tata Steel Limited\\nNot really. Of course, we will keep an eye on the balance sheet, and we want to make sure that we drive that balance\\nbetween our debt levels, balance sheet and growth. But India is value-accretive growth. I think India business is always\\ncash positive, and we can, in some sense, fund the growth. To that extent, the India growth will always get priority. But we\\nare also going through a process where a lot of detailed engineering is done. We are trying to reduce the cash-to-cash\\ncycle in our expansion projects. To that extent, we are doing a lot more engineering work before we start spending, taking\\nit to a higher [inaudible] levels before we start the spend. The work is going on continuously. There is no slowdown in the\\npace of work, but we will obviously time it appropriately. And we have said we will be 40 million tons by 2030. So that is\\nvery much on track.\\nAshish Jain, Macquarie\\nAnd if you can comment on it, are we likely to kind of prioritise NINL first just to optimize the cost there because the current\\nscale is quite small, or we are open to everything at this moment?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think in terms of sequence, apart from the EAF projects which can operate independently, I think after Kalinganagar, 5\\nmillion, which is moving from 3 to 8, the next phase is most likely to be Neelachal expansion. And then you have both\\nBhushan and the Kalinganagar 8 to 13 happening parallelly.\\nOperator\\nWe would now like hand over the conference to Ms. Samita Shah for chat questions. Over to you ma'am.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Samita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThanks, Kinshuk. So, we'll start with the questions. I think many questions on TSUK. Is the restructuring now done? And\\ndoes it include employee separation costs? And what will be the capex guidance for FY2025?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe restructuring is not done. We have taken provisioning as both Naren, and I mentioned that we are undergoing a\\nconsultation process. That is the process laid by the law of the land in the UK and that process involves first the informal\\nconsultation and then the formal consultation. We, for the last 1.5 months, have been in informal consultation with the\\nunions, their advisors, their reps at the ground level, and we will shortly commence a formal consultation when we finish\\nthe informal consultation of hearing them and then getting us on our way forward [inaudible] transition plan as well as the\\nfinancial impact that the running of that business is causing. The restructuring is planned, but it is not in the execution\\nphase. It will happen in the way that we are proposing and in agreement with the union. The unions obviously are very\\nsensitive to the impact of the restructuring. And we recognise that. And as I said earlier, as a responsible corporate, we\\ndo all that we can do in a coordinated manner. It is not completed, but we have a constructive obligation arising out of the\\nfact that any restructuring poses and that is what has been provided.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe other question was on the capex for FY2025.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. I think it would be best to talk about it in the next call when the plan gets finalized. Obviously, priority wise,\\nKalinganagar is the first priority to get completed. We want to ensure that the facilities get started. So that is the main\\npriority and we can see that in FY2025 that will rank the highest. This year, our spend has been higher on India capex,\\nand we will continue to be so in the next year, too.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is another question on TSUK. I think you've answered it, but maybe you could reiterate. Have we taken complete\\nprovision?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nIn the UK, yes, we have taken. And we have taken provisions both on the asset side as well as on the investment side. As\\nfar as UK is concerned, we have taken the provisions.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is also on UK. It says, the International Steel Traders Association have raised concerns about Tata\\nSteel UK utilizing most of the quotas in the past few quarters. So how will Tata Steel UK continue to import steel? And how\\nwill that work?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think there are safeguard quotas at this point of time, and we will look to engage formally with the trade regulatory\\nauthorities at an appropriate time. And because the quotas are also in the context of the fact that if the upstream in the UK\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"does not upgrade, we are the only flat product producer. From a trade perspective, that will be addressed in due course\\nof time.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is a question on Chinese steel imports, which I suppose is for India. It says, we have seen over 1 million tons of\\nimports in the first half of the fiscal year. Do you think the government will start an antidumping investigation?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think the government has recently mentioned that we will be looking at the certifications that are required and whether\\nthe steel coming in has those appropriate certifications. To me, yes, imports are higher than it has been last year. We have\\nseen worse in the past. The larger concern to me is less of Chinese imports into India, more of Chinese exports across\\nthe world because that is already 8 million tons for the last few months, which is not a good situation from an international\\nprice point of view. The Indian market has been strong, and so domestic prices have been stable because everyone is\\nable to sell what they produce. But internationally, we are hoping and expecting that China will be exporting less over the\\nnext few months than they did in the last 6 months. If you go back to the 5 - 6 million tons a month level, then you will have\\nmore stable steel prices. In the past, we have seen 10 million tons a month level. And now in the last 4 – 5 months, it has\\nbeen at 8 million tons a month. In India, yes, we are watching the imports. If it, of course, keeps going up, then there is\\ncertainly a case for looking at it, and we will talk to the government at that time.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nNext two questions are on India. This is about the subsidiaries and the merger. The first one is when do we plan to integrate\\nNINL with standalone, and do we get any tax benefits because of the mergers of Tata Steel Long Products and other\\nentities?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. First question on NINL. As part of the divestment process, there was a cooling off period of 3 years. This is not for\\nNINL, it’s in general. And therefore, we will have to wait for that period before we consider that. But in the meanwhile, as\\nNaren mentioned, the expansion, the stabilisation and the sweating of the assets are continuing. So yes, there is a time\\nperiod after which we can consider that. And the tax losses of TSLP etc. are part of the integration planning in which you\\nsee some of it reflected in the balance sheet.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on our ABJA bonds. What are your plans to refinance the 2024 bond maturities? Also, another\\nquestion, whether the capex and working capital trends will continue to reduce cash balance in the next quarter?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nThe first one, the ABJA bonds, it forms part of our deleveraging. There are 3 elements of that bond, and we will certainly\\nlook at our cash flow planning for next year. And if we are confident about repaying some part of it and refinancing the\\nbalance, we would certainly want to reduce and get the ABJA bonds paid off in due course of time whenever they are due,\\nmostly next year and then in 2028. And that's how we are planning our financials on that basis.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"As far as capex is concerned and the cash levels are concerned, I think the capex will soon turn into generation as the\\nPhase 2 expansion of Kalinganagar comes in. We should start seeing benefit from FY2025, second half in particular. And\\nthen as the ramp-up increases, FY2026 should be the one where we will get the maximum benefit. So once those kinds\\nof things happen, the debt levels will certainly start looking down.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is back on Europe. What kind of sales volume do we expect from TSUK and Netherlands in FY2024\\nand FY2025?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, FY2024 and FY2025, the numbers we had guided for earlier.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI think the projection now is about 8.5 million for FY2024.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. That is total TSE.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nFY2025, I think, hopefully, we will go back to the longer-term level because this 8.5 million tons factors a blast furnace\\ndown for quite some time.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nCloser to 10 million tons.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. Between 9 million and 10 million tons.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question again is on volumes for FY2025, and we don't really give them so early, but I'll just take this question.\\nWhat is the timeline for KPO-2 blast furnace commissioning? Which I think you answered. How much commercial volumes\\nexpected in FY2025? I think this is more related to TSK Phase 2.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nYes. I think we will probably give better guidance in the next call. Blast furnaces ramp up fast. Then the steel melt shop,\\nand the hot strip mills. In fact, we will probably have a bit of extra slabs for some time, but I think we will be in a better\\nposition to give guidance in the next analyst call for the next year's volumes.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Samita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nAgain, questions on UK, I'll just club a couple of them. What will be the cash outflow in onetime restructuring, excluding\\nthe staff-related cost? And what is the funding plan for the £750 million capex needs of UK transition? And will there be\\nany further impairment charges expected?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nI don't expect any further impairment charges in the UK. We have taken all of that. The funding plan for £750 million will\\nbe a mix of, first, the equity from India and part of it would be debt. That is something that we are working on. I think the\\ncash flows are strong enough as projected to support that. We will combine the two, but there will be a larger equity\\ncomponent from India to support it, and then we can replace the same. What was the first question, Samita?\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThis was about the cash outflow in terms of the restructuring costs at UK excluding employee costs.\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nWell, that's like trying to slice the cake. I think we just need to go through the consultation process first, and then we will\\nbe able to firm that up. I can give you the elements of that restructuring, which will be elements like decommissioning or\\nmothballing any of the facilities, especially as in our current context, the hot strip mill will have to be upgraded, the caster\\nhas to be upgraded. So, during the time these are upgraded, they will be decommissioned or mothballed to facilitate that\\n[inaudible]. I think those are the ones I would say that the redundancy provisions or the restructuring costs largely relates\\nto, but we don't yet have a handle on the number until we complete the consultation process.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThe next question is on India, on the NRs and the market conditions. I think you mentioned it in your speech, Naren, but if\\nyou can just elaborate about it and the outlook for the rest of the quarter.\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nI think what we've guided is 3Q will be about Rs. 2,200 per ton higher than 2Q as far as realisations are concerned. Like I\\nsaid, demand is strong. We've seen 10% growth in consumption on YoY basis because all engines are firing, automotive\\nis strong, construction is good and rural markets are picking up. I think the only gap is a little bit more on what's happening\\nin the international markets and international prices, but domestic is quite strong.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nWe'll move to Netherlands, where there are questions about the potential decarbonization project. What will be the capex?\\nWhat is the configuration they are looking at? Would there be a production loss in the interim? And how will we fund it?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nJust now we are in conversation with the government on the configuration. Based on that configuration, the capex will be\\nfinalised. And the intent is, as we said earlier that the BF6 will continue because it is a new furnace. And the other furnace\\nwill get replaced. What is the exact configuration is something that we will be looking at. But roughly, from a volume terms,\\nthe first phase will be a 3 million tons transition. But I think the funding, the capex etc. is a matter of negotiation and\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"discussion with the government. And we are deeply engaged in it. The submission of the broader plan is going to happen\\nshortly. And then based on the feedback, as Naren mentioned, we will go through the phase during which the negotiation\\nfor the support is discussed and the balance will be by the company, largely out of Tata Steel Netherlands, and that is the\\nfunding plan that we will finally come about and disclose. There is some time to do that. It is not happening imminently,\\nbut it will certainly happen in the near future.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere is a question on India now, which is more about our strategy vis-a-vis downstream assets. Is it about market share?\\nIs it about profitable growth? Can you explain how you see this growth panning out in India?\\nT. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo, I think downstream has always been an important part of our strategy because we see that as you have more\\ndownstream businesses, you are closer to the customers, final consumers and you are also insulated to some extent from\\nthe cyclicality or at least there is a lag in the cycles and that helps us. Our biggest downstream presence is in the tubes\\nbusiness, the pipes business, which is today 1 million tons, and we want to take it to about 4 million tons by the end of the\\ndecade, and that will keep pace with our hot rolling capacity when we are at 40 million tons of steel, we will have about 27\\nmillion tons of flat products. We think a 4 - 5 million ton tube business is a good footprint and downstream to support the\\nupstream as well as add value to the upstream. The second big downstream business we have is the wires business,\\nwhich is more linked to long products, where, again, we are the large player with more than 0.5 million tons and a strong\\nmarket share in segments like the stranded wires and tire bead wires etc. There, again, we want to double it in the next\\nfew years, and that will also be aligned with the Neelachal expansion. The third one is the packaging or the tinplate\\nbusiness, where again, we are about 400,000 tons, and we want to take it to about 1 million tons. That will also support\\nthe flat products business because it is downstream of the flat products business. I'm talking only of India because we\\nhave a big packaging business in Europe as well. The last one is, of course, linked to Metaliks, which is a DI pipe business\\nthat is downstream for the pig iron that we make through the mini blast furnaces that we have in Tata Metaliks. There,\\nagain, we are a big player, and we aim to become about 1 million tons over the next year. These businesses, which have\\nalways traditionally added value. The EBITDA margins of downstream are lower than the typical steel business, but the\\nROIC tends to be higher because these businesses are run like that. And I think that's our ambition as far as downstream\\nis concerned. There are many other smaller things that we do, but these are the 4 big ones.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nWe have some more questions on the bonds. I think we have either some bond investors or some banks on the call. This\\nis in terms of the bond maturities for next year. Will you come offshore? Or will you look to do onshore financing instead?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO - Tata Steel Limited\\nI think it's premature to say that, but we would certainly first look at what we can do internally and the balance outside. But\\ntypically, we will first look at options and the India balance sheet in preference to anything offshore.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nAnd I think the last question is on TSN. This is about, again, the performance in this quarter, and I think we mentioned\\nabout slabs etc. There are a few questions on how do we manage the slab inventory? Do we have a policy and what is\\napproach towards managing the price risk for TSN as well as TSUK because they buy slab?\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"T. V. Narendran: CEO & MD - Tata Steel Limited\\nSo normally, TSN, we don't buy slabs. It's just that we stocked up on slabs because we knew the blast furnace was going\\ndown, and we needed the slabs to take care of our customers and our orders. But otherwise, it is a fairly balanced facility.\\nWe make as much slabs as we can consume. And if there are extra slabs, we can always look at selling it, but we don't\\nnecessarily buy slabs in Netherlands. In the UK, also, we don't buy slabs. But going forward, depending on, as Koushik\\nsaid, the outcome of the consultations and the way we plan the transition, we will decide what to do and when. But again,\\nI repeat what Koushik and I have said, whatever we do, we will try to make sure that the business is run in a cash neutral\\nor cash positive way.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nThere's one more question, I think, in terms of Tata tinplate. This essentially says that results have been poor at a time\\nwhen the demand has been quite strong. Is there an excess supply of tinplate in the Indian market? And can you comment\\non the market position?\\nKoushik Chatterjee: ED & CFO – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think there are fundamentally two points. One is that the value addition, which is the gap between the hot rolled coil and\\ntinplate has shrunk compared to the previous quarter significantly. The issue has been, there has been a lot of import of\\nnon-prime tinplate into India. And that has created a supply-demand imbalance [inaudible]. Hopefully, this will get reversed\\nin the future. But we also see a certain amount of firming up of the value addition and improvement from the value addition\\nthat was there in the second quarter. The second quarter was really difficult because it suddenly shrunk. But as I said, it\\nis not because of supply of prime tinplate from us and our peers, but it was more on the non-prime imports that came in.\\nSamita Shah: VP CFTRM – Tata Steel Limited\\nI think that ends the questions we have. We will end the call now. Thank you very much, everybody, for joining us today,\\nand I hope we were able to provide you all the clarifications you sought. And until the next call, thank you.\\nT. V.

              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThank you. Can you go to the next slide, please? The standard safe harbor statement, Yep. Nothing\\nadditional to add here. No further changes to any accounting statements or anything. From a quarter\\nperspective, a series of actions underway this quarter. Let me try and tease out the ones that are really\\nbig here. The portfolio of CNGs which Shailesh is going to talk about later, doing well for us and 1000 odd\\ne-Buses, with the latest being Srinagar that was launched yesterday and of course getting ready for the\\nfuture perspective, I think both in Tata Motors and in JLR, the whole testing sites for EVs as well as here\\nthe H2, ICE testing facility in India both big ones coming through. And in JLR, the conﬁdence of the future\\nof cash ﬂows being manifested in the bonds that were bought back as well as the China loan that was\\nrepaid, which I'm sure will get covered later in the discussion. Next slide, please.\\nOverall revenues, we came in at ~Rs.1,05,000 crores for the quarter with an EBITDA of 13.7% and EBIT\\nnumber of 7.5%. If you recollect, we did signal that we are going to have a temporary blip between Q1\\nand Q2 because of the summer shutdowns that we had in JLR, that's exactly how it has played out and\\nPBT(bei) came in at ~Rs. 6,100 crores. I am sure, there is going to be a question later today in terms of\\nwhy is it that between PBT and PAT, the tax costs have gone up signiﬁcantly. Let me cover that right away.\\nGiven JLR's earlier performance, we are not in a position to recognize the deferred tax asset in excess of\\nour deferred tax liabilities and therefore, because it's an asset recognition accounting, will force you to\\nshow a consistent track record for that and that is what is causing a bit of noise on that. Happy to dwell in\\nfurther detail in case you want further detail but on an overall basis, the tax rate remains the same 25%\\nthat we had already signaled, no change to that. Free cash ﬂows came in strong again this quarter at Rs.\\n3,900 crores. I also want to quickly cover the H1 numbers that you see. PBT (bei) stepping up by almost\\nRs.18,000 crores and on a year on year basis, the cash ﬂows have also stepped up by Rs. 15,000 crores,\\ntaking the net debt down to Rs. 38,700 crores. So well on track to whatever commitments we had on the\\ndeleverage plan. Next slide, please?\\nSplit of growth between volume and mostly led by volume, mix and price and translation, of course yielded\\na little bit. Proﬁtability particularly pleasing because every vertical was ﬁring on the proﬁtability side and\\nhence contributing to the overall increase that you see. And the net automotive debt at Rs.38,700 crores.\\nSplit it up by Tata Motors, India, I think we are very conﬁdent this business will go net cash by end of this\\nyear and the JLR by the next year and therefore we believe we are well on track for deleveraging targets.\\nNext slide.\\nFrom a corporate action side, a lot of action, some of this you have already seen the news. First was Tata\\nTechnologies where we had a pre-IPO deal which we signed with TPG Climate Rise which is and Ratan Tata\\nEndowment fund and it is actually a strategic sale and to that extent this business is going to beneﬁt from\\nsomeone like TPG Rise coming in, and it's a climate dedicated fund and their experience in investing in\\ngreen technologies will be of beneﬁt to us. This transaction has been closed and cash has been received\\nin the last few days. And of course from an IPO perspective, their actions are underway and the timing of\\ncourse will be decided by the TTL board, post ﬁnal approvals. Next slide.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nThe second transaction that we did was acquisition of a 27% stake in Freight Tiger. I haven't yet talked\\nabout it, maybe I'll take a minute to spend on it. Indian freight market is massive and fragmented and\\nhere while in trucks, a lot of investments have gone in; not to be said the same about freight ordering or\\nmanagement or the whole freight process. Therefore this is an area where Freight Tiger tries to solve that\\nproblem, by providing an end to end digital software as a service solution. Fleet Edge is a trucking product\\nthat we have which sits on our connected vehicle platform and helps both ﬂeet operators and drivers. By\\nintegrating these two, we can give a comprehensive freight management solution and therefore from the\\nstakeholders and I'm very careful to use the word stakeholder, because there are so many stakeholders\\nin this. For the shipper, it's going to result in lower freight costs because of matching; there is for the\\ntransporters, there's better transparency on freight availability, faster payments for the entire truck\\noperators there; for everybody, enhanced visibility and reliability. And therefore, this is quite an\\ninteresting transaction coming through and ﬁts in very well with Girish's digital plan that we have, for the\\nCV business. The transaction, we will invest Rs. 150 crores, which we have already done. The money has\\nalready gone out of our bank for this one and we are now at 26.79% owner where CPs have been\\ncompleted and in the next two to three years we will invest an additional Rs. 100 crores as required, and\\nthereafter we will have the right to buy the other investors at the then fair market value. A very interesting\\ntransaction, something we are very excited by. Next slide.\\nThis is a latest one that's just been announced where AVINYA will be underpinned by JLR's EMA platform.\\nI'm sure Shailesh and Adrian both can talk about it later in the presentation, but it's a very important\\ntransaction for us because this is TPEM's premium pure electric vehicle series AVINYA which we revealed\\nlast year. And this will be developed on EMA with JLR, which is well underway on timelines to launch the\\nﬁrst car and this will be an MoU for access to the EMA platform, including the electrical/electronic\\narchitectures, the EDUs, the drive units that is, battery assembly and the manufacturing know-how for a\\nroyalty fee. For us, it accelerates our entry into the high end segment, it delivers a global product upfront,\\nreduces development costs and cycle time because it would have been already validated by JLR and\\naccelerates our adoption of advanced ACES technologies. So this helps Tata Motors leapfrog the market\\nas far as the Indian market is concerned. But this is not being conceived only for India, it's actually being\\nconceived as a global product, which makes it a very interesting proposition for us. So these are the three\\nactions that we had from a corporate side. Let me now hand it over to Richard to take you through the\\nJLR story.\\nRichard, over to you.\\n\\nRichard Molyneux\\nThank you very much Balaji. Yes, so let's go to the next chart, because it's important to show JLR is really\\ndelivering strongly both ﬁnancially and operationally. We are setting records. So, if you look at the top\\nline, our Q2 performance, revenue up 30% year on year to GBP 6.9 billion pounds, that is a record, we\\nhave never achieved that level before in Q2. EBIT is down a little bit at 7.3% for the quarter. We always\\nmentioned when we showed the Q1 numbers that there was a small one oﬀ favorable in there that would\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nfeed back out. So it's actually probably more relevant to look at the H1 EBIT of 8%. PBT in the quarter, GBP\\n442 million and GBP 300 million of free cash ﬂow. What that means for the ﬁrst half of the year is GBP\\n13.8 billion worth of revenue, which is a record. It's also a record in terms of per unit. In terms of per unit,\\nwe're now up at GBP 72,000 per car, delivering 8% EBIT, GBP 877 million worth of PBT, which is up GBP1.6\\nbillion year over year and an H1 cash ﬂow of GBP 751 million pounds. That is not only an H1 record cash\\nﬂow for us, it is a record cash ﬂow by GBP 250 million. So, we are setting records, we are delivering well.\\nSo if we move on to the next chart.\\nI won't go through this in detail. This will cover the comments that I have made and will make as we go\\nthrough this presentation. It's there for your record, so you can go back to it afterwards.\\nSo, we move on to the next chart, which shows our wholesale performance, which was up 4% in the\\nquarter, from 93,000 to 97,000 units, up 29% for the half. In terms of the brands, Range Rover fairly ﬂat.\\nLook, this is something that's expected for us. We are still production constrained on Range Rover and as\\nBalaji mentioned we have a two week plant shutdown in the quarter. So it's no surprise that that's ﬂat.\\nDefender continues to do extremely well for us, 30,000 units in the quarter and Jaguar was also up in the\\nquarter. Although if you look at the table of the ﬁrst half of the year below you can see Jaguar is pretty\\nﬂat and the volume increase is coming primarily from Range Rover and Defender, which is up considerably\\non a year-by- year basis. So on a H1 to H1 basis, we are up 29%. Next chart.\\nSo if we look at this on a regional basis, I think the only thing I'll point out in terms of both the quarter is,\\nlook China we know, is a very, very tough market at the moment, but we are showing strong resilience in\\nthat market. Actually, quarter on quarter we're up and we're fairly ﬂat year on year and that does show\\nthe power of the modern luxury brands that we have and how they can cut through at the top end some\\nof the noise and the pressures of the market. Most of the other regions performed really well. If you look\\nat the second bar chart down there, the ﬁrst half of the year, every single region is doing better than it\\nwas in the previous year. In terms of the bars on the right, our percentage of electriﬁed vehicles that's\\nboth PHEV and BEV was relatively ﬂat in the quarter. Actually, it went up from 12.7% to 13% but that's a\\nnumber that we expect to stay fairly static until we launch our new BEV, starting with the Range Rover\\nBEV at the end of next year. Next chart.\\nSo the next chart shows the development of our proﬁt before tax from last year to this year and shows an\\nincrease of GBP 615 million year over year in our PBT delivery. So just explaining that the largest chunk,\\nquite obviously, is volume and mix. Volume was 21,500 units higher than the previous year and mix is also\\nstronger, that is Defender up from 23% to 31% and Ranger Rover Sport up from 6% to 17%. So both\\npositives in terms of volume and in terms of mix. Pricing for us is also something which has been positive\\nover the last year. We are showing a very small increase in our variable marketing expense but do note\\nthat's going from 1.1% to 1.5%, those are levels which are still extremely strong and represents the sort\\nof the need to not discount greatly in the modern luxury space of the market. So, we have done very well\\nto keep VME at those types of levels whilst keeping order bank of 168,000 units. Material cost is actually\\nfavorable for us in this quarter, that is largely because of this time last year was when we were really\\nsuﬀering in terms of material cost, particularly in terms of the amounts that we were having to spend to\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nbrokers to source semiconductor chips. As that industry has stabilized now, we don't need to spend those\\nmoney. So on a year to year basis, material cost is actually showing some improvements for us. We do\\nknow that we're going to have to continue to spend some money on demand generation. So you can see\\nthere GBP 96 million adverse year over year in FME and selling, of that GBP 62 million was in marketing\\nexpense. Some of you that have been following the Rugby World Cup that's been going on will have\\nspotted where a chunk of that went in terms of our sponsorship through Defender of the Rugby World\\nCup. Foreign exchange, actually net favorable for us year-over-year. One year ago, this quarter was the\\nquarter when we had the premiership of Liz Truss and Sterling did take a step down to $1.10. It's come\\nback up this quarter to circa $1.22. That's given us an operational FX adverse, but quite a strong hedge\\nposition and the revaluation of our balance sheet and debt meant that the net foreign exchange impact\\nfor us is favorable so that's the explanation. But don't lose sight of the bottom line. We have improved\\nour PBT by GBP 615 million versus the same quarter last year and that PBT is the best that we have had\\nfor several years. Next chart, please.\\nHere we go. This then takes PBT through to cash ﬂow. The number I'd like to focus there is the cash proﬁt\\nafter tax but before investments at GBP 1.151 billion. That is also a record for us, by the way. But as much\\nas being a record, I'd like to focus on the consistency of that number. In the last three quarters, that\\nnumber has been GBP 1.116 billion, then GBP 1.135 billion and now GBP 1.151 billion. So we are very\\nconsistently delivering GBP 1.1 billion of cash proﬁt after tax. That's a really strong message. We did spend\\na little bit more on investment. I'll come and talk about that in a minute that's a natural part of our cycle\\nplan and working capital was a little bit adverse for us in the quarter. That is largely the eﬀect of the two\\nweek summer shutdown has in terms of our payables. However, we delivered GBP300 million worth of\\nfree cash ﬂow. Next chart.\\nIn terms of our investment, we've spent GBP 775 million of that GBP 577 million was engineering and 64%\\nof that or GBP 368 million was capitalized. I think it is important to understand that for us, that\\ncapitalization ratio is something that does wax and wane according to where we are in the product\\nlifecycle. So if I look at it, for the same quarter last year it was 40%, same quarter the year before it was\\n37%, same quarter the year before that it was 68%. So this is something that will evolve for us. It always\\ngets higher as we approach major launches because then the engineers are working on programs that\\nhave passed their capitalization hurdles and it always goes down when we are working on programs which\\nare further into the future. So, we would expect that level to probably increase a little bit over the next\\ncouple of quarters and then as we move through next year to start coming down. Next chart.\\nGreat, business update. So, if we move forward, you can see here, this is our wholesale history. You can\\nsee the trend from that low point of just sub 65,000 units in Q2 FY 2022. We are continuing to improve\\nout and in the next couple of quarters, we will improve those deliveries more. That's partly as a result of\\nsomething I'll come and talk to you about on MLA in a second and partly the result of there are greater\\nworking days in the next two quarters than there were in the last two. We're not completely out of the\\nwoods on supply constraints yet. They still do appear, but they are pairing in slightly diﬀerent guises. It's\\nnot really major semiconductor constraints that we're seeing. We're seeing the type of events and\\nchallenges that are slightly more normal, in an industry where unfortunately you get ﬂoods at suppliers\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nor ﬁres at suppliers, but we're getting very good at responding to those very fast. So we do expect Q3 and\\nQ4, both wholesale volumes and production volumes to improve even over the numbers that you can see\\nthere on that page. Next chart.\\nNow, you all know how important Range Rover and Range Rover Sport are for us and that Range Rover\\nand Range Rover Sport and Defender makes 77% of our current order bank. So production of those\\nvehicles is extremely important. We did manage to keep it constant quarter over quarter, in terms of\\naverage number of vehicles produced per week, but we did manage to trial through one week of 3,200\\ncars in fact to be precise, 3,263 was our peak volume. We expect that to continue to improve through the\\nback end of the year. We do have an additional body shop for MLA coming on stream, towards the end of\\nthis month. That will start a ramp up process, but it will allow us to increase those numbers as we go into\\nthe back end of this quarter and through into next year. Then next chart.\\nSo, where do we stand? We are performing well operationally, ﬁnancially and we're setting records and\\nwe expect to be able to set more records in the quarters ahead. So, we expect our volumes to recover,\\nwe expect inﬂation to moderate and we are changing our guidance in terms of EBIT from prior guidance\\nof 6% plus to around 8%. That shows the conﬁdence in the delivery that we are currently producing that\\nwe can maintain those levels. Net debt, we ended the quarter at GBP 2.249 billion so GBP 2.25 billion,\\nthat is exactly half of it was a year ago so we have halved our net debt in 12-months and we commit to\\nget that net debt down from GBP 2.249 billion to lower than GBP1 billion by the end of this ﬁnancial year.\\nWe will focus on execution, executing our plans ﬂawlessly and continuing to deliver both ﬁnancially and\\noperationally.\\nThank you. I'll hand back to Balaji.\\n\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Richard. Quickly moving on to commercial vehicles, Girish and I will take this section. Next slide\\nplease.\\nOn the market share front, we had an improvement sequentially from 39.1% to 39.7%. Particularly,\\nhearteningly, the heavies are starting to do well and as the supply chain issues, the portfolio gaps that we\\nhad, then even the ILMCV sections are doing well, but we do have a challenge on the small commercial\\nvehicles and that's an area which we are well focused on to ensure that comes back again. It will take a\\nlittle bit of time as we pivot this business to a B2C kind of a thinking, so that is something which we are\\nworking on. Next slide please.\\nBut, the work on pivot to quality is yielding us handsome returns. Revenue is up by 22% at ~Rs. 20,000\\ncrores and EBITDA up by 540 bps and now at 10.4%, we committed to deliver a double digit EBITDA, we\\nhave delivered this quarter as well as on a half year basis and of course from a proﬁtability perspective\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nthis business has generated about Rs. 1,500 crores this quarter and overall Rs .2,500 crores for the year\\nso far. So on a very good track as far as proﬁtability is concerned. Next slide.\\nWhere did the monies come from? A combination of volume mix as well as draw your attention to\\nrealization increase, so substantial improvement coming through there. That was a strategy, that is what\\nis yielding us the beneﬁts and as you saw in the previous slide, it is also yielding market shares in the key\\nheavies and the intermediate sections. But of course work to be done on the smalls. Next slide please.\\nLet me hand it over to Girish to give you a sense from a business ﬂavor perspective. Girish, over to you.\\nGirish Wagh\\nSo, thanks Balaji. So we had good growth in volumes, almost 21% quarter-on-quarter and 6% year-onyear with all the availability issues that we had in Q1 being addressed. Balaji has already spoken about the\\nmarket share and I think if I may say, in M&HCV our Q2 market share is now already ahead of the FY 2023\\nmarket share. In ILMCV and passenger we are growing market share month over month as the availability\\nissues have been addressed and in small commercial vehicle and pickups I think as Balaji mentioned, we\\nare pivoting towards, on one hand improving the unit economics and on the other hand improving the\\nbusiness model from B2B to B2C, and we will claw back the market share as we go ahead. If you see the\\nnon-vehicle business revenue also grew by 20% over Q2 of last year, so this is one business that has been\\ngrowing handsomely. It's very good improvement in penetration in the spare parts as well as service. We\\nhad around 17% of our volumes being generated through digital channels, leads from digital channels. So\\nI think we are consistently maintaining it at this level. If you look at bright spots, ﬁrst is for us, the trucks\\nthat is M&HCVs grew by 24% over the same quarter last year. Passenger carriers grew, that is buses and\\nvans grew by almost 32%. I think the customer sentiment index, it remained ﬁrm or improved across\\nsegments. So generally second quarter, monsoon quarter does see a dip in medium and heavy commercial\\nvehicles, which is what we saw, but otherwise the other segments did well. On the commodities, we had\\ntailwind due to softening of commodities, especially steel and precious metal, so had good tailwind on\\nthe margins and of course I think we have been pushing our cost reduction eﬀorts as also improving\\nrealizations month over month, which is all what has helped in margin improvement. I must also say, I\\nthink post the introduction of BS6 Phase II, we have been getting good traction on all products and there\\nhas been a lot of focus on inﬂuencer advocacy as well as a lot of in market back to back trials to prove the\\nimprovement in total cost of ownership. In addition to this, we have also introduced more than 200\\nvariants within quarter two to expand the portfolio. So going ahead, I think we are quite clear we will\\ncontinue to drive the realization improvement. We have already taken a price increase on October 1,\\nbecause we see some commodity headwinds, especially from steel coming in Q3, likely to come in Q3, so\\nthat's the price increase that we have taken. And while we continue to drive realization improvement, we\\nwill keep upping the Vahaan share, which is what we are focusing on with the help of our BS6 Phase II\\nproduct range. We, of course have a very diﬀerentiated focus on SCV portfolio, I already spoke about that.\\nWe are driving now proﬁtable growth and building a very sustainable model. So pull-based model rather\\nthan having a push - VME based push. We have been scaling up our EV supplies, both the Ace EV as well\\nas the electric buses and I'll speak about this in detail on the next slide. We will obviously continue the\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\ngrowth in our spares and service penetration and therefore the revenue from the downstream business.\\nIn international markets we have been maintaining our market shares in all the key markets, have\\nimproved our margins and we are also maintaining channel health as the total industry volumes in most\\nof these markets are below even the last year. Next slide.\\nIf I speak about the electric mobility in detail, now we have almost, let me ﬁrst speak about Ace. So we\\nhave more than 1600 Ace EVs plying on the roads and together they have clocked more than 4 million\\nkilometers, so good experience under the belt now. I am also pleased to inform you that just two days\\nback we have received the PLI certiﬁcate. So Ace EV becomes the ﬁrst four-wheeled commercial electric\\nvehicle to receive the PLI certiﬁcate. With this, we will now further strengthen our eﬀorts in increasing\\nthe volumes. The retail numbers of Ace EV are growing month over month and we continue a strong\\nengagement with the ecosystem stakeholders to ensure ﬁnance availability, charging infrastructure\\navailability, as also enhancing our reach to keep on scaling up the volumes. Coming to the smart city\\nmobility solution. So, we have now almost 500 electric buses deployed between Delhi Transport\\nCorporation and just yesterday we had inauguration of our buses supplied to Jammu and Kashmir also.\\nCumulatively, we have now crossed more than 97 million kilometers and I think in all the contracts we are\\ndelivering more than 95% uptime and almost close to 100% uptime towards the end of quarter two. I\\nthink the buses have been delivering pretty well. I already spoke about Jammu and Kashmir and I think\\nthe focus that we have in this business right now is laying a foundation for a very strong business, a lot of\\nfocus on putting in place processes, IT and digital enablement. We also received ISO certiﬁcates for some\\nof our depots which have been started a year back and we'll continue to do the same for other depots\\nalso. I am also very happy to let you know that we had taken a speciﬁc position on the new tenders in\\nabsence of the payment security mechanism and we have been having a lot of engagement with the\\ngovernment. A lot of positive response from the government and as we understand in the new tender,\\nwhich is likely to come up from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Aﬀairs, payment security mechanism\\nmay ﬁnd a place in that, which will see us coming back aggressively in this space. On the digital side, I think\\nBalaji has already spoken about the Freight Tiger piece. So the Freight Tiger operates in the logistics\\necosystem, whereas Fleet Edge is a very strong platform in the truck ecosystem. We now have almost half\\na million vehicles on the platform and we continue to grow this, the engagement times are also improving\\nmonth over month. We introduced the subscription modules from second quarter and we've seen a good\\ntraction from the customers for the same. As I said, the engagement time is being improved with\\nenhanced information and contextual insights on operations, that is operations of the trucks, the vehicle\\nhealth and the driving behavior, which is actually helping the customers to improve their real time total\\ncost of ownership. I won't speak further on the Freight Tiger, as Balaji has spoken about it, but actually it\\nprovides a very comprehensive end to end solution for us, connecting both the truck ecosystem and the\\ntrip ecosystem and will actually be a win-win proposition for all the stakeholders whether it is the shippers,\\nthe logistics service providers and ﬂeet owners which are going to be our customers. E-Dukaan, which is\\nour online marketplace for the spare parts. I think we have grown very handsomely 4 times over Q2 of FY\\n2023 and I must say, actually, this is helping us to improve the penetration, so the customers who\\notherwise would have not bought from us or gone for secondhand I think are coming to us through this.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nThe last point I would say retails, as I said from the digital leads, also continue to be healthy. Almost 17%\\nof our volumes are coming from that. So, that's the summary of CV business.\\nBalaji, back to you.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Girish. Going on to the PV side. Next slide please.\\nVahaan domestic market shares are at 13.4% for the quarter. If you recollect, we said the ﬁrst half of the\\nyear is going to be challenging for us because we have our products are all coming rear ended, while most\\nof competition has launched their products in the ﬁrst half. So pretty happy to see the way it ended at\\n13.4%. At the same time, if we look at the October month, we did come back into the 14% plus zone, so\\nit's exactly in line with what we had planned. The other reassuring piece is the EV as a portion of the total\\nportfolio sitting at 13%. I am seeing a lot of questions coming on EV growth, which I am sure Girish or\\nShailesh will cover quite extensively in his Q&A. Next slide, please.\\nOverall EV volumes, remember that this is a transition quarter for us, because in the entire PV business\\nwe had our three big products: Nexon undergoing a change, both the ICE version as well as the EV version.\\nSafari, Harrier launching in October. So to that extent it has been a quarter where we had to manage the\\nins and outs and that explains the EV volume sequential decline that you see, but year on year continues\\nto do well. And the way the Nexon orders are currently picking up, which I again see a lot of questions on,\\nwe are quite comfortable with the way it is currently positioned. Next slide, please.\\nOverall numbers, the revenues went down 3% for the reasons I just explained, but despite that, EBITDA\\nup 110 bps at 6.5%, EBIT at 1.8%, plus 140 bps and PBT (bei) of about Rs. 300 crores for the quarter and\\nRs. 500 crores for the year, so far. The business is starting to step up the proﬁtability once again. Next\\nslide, please.\\nThis is probably the most eagerly awaited slide. How do we split the PV/EV numbers. Hold that point for\\na minute. See where the monies have come from because the volume decline and the mix, because don't\\nforget that Nexon, Harrier and Safari are our most proﬁtable products. Those were the ones where we\\ndid see a volume challenge and that's the reason the volume and mix are taking the EBIT numbers down.\\nAt the same time, variable cost, signiﬁcant savings starting to come through, including in battery prices as\\nwe had indicated last time and hence the proﬁtability coming up because of that. Fixed cost increases\\nfundamentally coming out, a fair amount of amortization being pushed through as well as charge outs of\\nCapex, this is happening and the step up in FMEs is also of course for the ﬁxed cost number, which we are\\nnot unduly concerned about. On the EV line, the PV business right now from an EBITDA perspective is at\\n9.2%, which are very important number because this is a business earlier we wanted to be as close to\\ndouble digit EBITDA as possible. We are there, so this business is now nearing the double digit EBITDA\\nthat we once had an aspiration for, that aspiration has turned into reality. At the same time the EV\\nbusiness size is stepping up and the EBITDA of minus 5% or Rs.100 crore loss that you see needs to be\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\ncontrasted with some of the numbers that have come out from some of the global OEMs. We are well in\\ncontrol of our numbers and very much in the aﬀordability zone and this is particularly noteworthy because\\nalmost this entire Rs. 100 crores is product development expenses that are being charged oﬀ. And this\\nEBITDA will continue to increase further as the battery prices come oﬀ further as new contracts are coming\\nin place, you should see an improvement in Q3 and a signiﬁcant improvement in Q4. Again, remember,\\nno PLI beneﬁts have been considered on this so that comes and adds on top of it. So we have the business\\nvery well positioned for both growth and proﬁtability increase and market share in the second half of the\\nyear as the new products start coming through. Next slide? Shailesh?\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nThank you Balaji. So, let me start with the industry highlights ﬁrst. In quarter two, the high base eﬀect of\\nlast year quarter two kicked in and the wholesale was just a single digit growth which was 5%. It is\\nimportant to note that 8% of the sales is now accounted by the new nameplate launches in the industry.\\nThe segment shift, the structural shift that we have been seeing towards SUVs further pronounced in the\\nquarter two, now it is at 50% plus share which is at the cost of the decline of hatches. As far as Tata Motors\\nPV and EV business is concerned, as Balaji mentioned that the focus was to manage the model transitions\\nwell while keeping the wholesale volume maintained in line with the plan. And we delivered that. There\\nhas been a sequential margin growth as Balaji already covered that point. Very important that we have\\nbeen trending now, number two in hatch segment. We sold about 48,000 numbers in quarter two and\\nthis is basically on the back of the multi-powertrain strategy that we have, which is CNG, electric as well\\nas petrol, which is really delivering higher volumes in a very challenged segment, I would say. Talking\\nabout the bright spots in the industry, I believe that quarter three is going to see sustained momentum.\\nYou already saw the ﬁrst month was a very high wholesale month. There's a strong retail momentum that\\none is seeing in the festive period and festive periods end after Diwali. So, we don't see a problem in terms\\nof the demand as it was being anticipated. Supply concern clearly looks to be eased out, particularly when\\nwe talk about the semiconductor. As far as Tata Motors is concerned, we launched the iCNG version range,\\nif you remember, in May, that is, in quarter one we had launched Altroz iCNG, which was the ﬁrst product\\nwith twin cylinder technology, really was received well. And in quarter two, we launched three additional\\nproducts with twin cylinder technology, which was Punch iCNG and Tiago and Tigor. Must say that all of\\nthem are really doing good. Balaji showed that in H1 we are at 13% share in CNG, but this has grown to\\nnearly 20% now. Launch of new Nexon, Nexon EV is another point which Balaji had mentioned, but these\\ntwo launches have really been good. You know while the waiting periods were very high in the ﬁrst month,\\nbut in the last two months we have nearly supplied 32,000 numbers and that has moderated the waiting\\nperiod to 3 to 4 months period. Now, Harrier and Safari was also the other facelift that we launched in\\nthe last month, which is October. This is the most safe car as per the GNCAP. We were able to get 5 star\\nrating, but with the highest ever score that any car in India has got, very strong bookings coming in it's\\nwith all the segment leading features and we strongly believe that this is also going to do well. So all the\\nlaunches that recently we have done, which is CNG, Nexon, Harrier and Safari really augers well for us in\\nquarter three and going forward. In terms of challenges yes, high levels of channel inventory, as you\\nknow, in the industry, in anticipation of a strong festive season, hopefully the Diwali will also have strong\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\ndemand outlook, so therefore we expect that inventory should come within the normal levels. Regulatory\\nsupport reduced for EVs in some key markets, but particularly I'm talking about Telangana, where there\\nis uncertainty around the road tax waiver, hope that will get clariﬁed and therefore the volumes are going\\nto come back. As I said that SUVs have gained their salience but this has come at the cost of hatches and\\nsedans. So therefore our plan would be to ramp up the supply for the new launches to drive volume\\ngrowth. We have done well for Nexon so far in two months. Harrier, Safari went through a ramp-up phase\\nlast month. Hopefully, we should be able to deliver supplies, strong supplies in this month. We have taken\\nsome very targeted actions to sustain our volumes in hatches and sedans. As you know, these two\\nsegments are de- growing but with the advantage of the multi-powertrain strategy that we have and\\ncertain micro markets and customer segments, we are planning to see how we can sustain our volumes\\nhere.\\nBack to you Balaji.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThank you Shailesh. Overall, let me accelerate a bit here. Go to the next slide please.\\nCash ﬂows only draw your attention. Cash proﬁts signiﬁcantly higher than the enhanced Capex that we\\nare running it, so business is living well within its means. Next slide please.\\nAgain, investment spending, we are clocking well. We have guided to an Rs. 8000 crore spend this year\\nand we are on track to deliver on that number and that just ensures that the overall product plans are all\\nwell funded. Next slide.\\nOn TMF. A minute on this. This is a business that had its challenges earlier, but we are coming through on\\nplan. The business is gradually getting its act together after the challenges that they faced last year around\\nOctober and the concerted collection eﬀorts are delivering results and the eﬃciency is now 97%,\\nimproving. GNPA though contained at 8.1% but on an absolute number basis what used to be almost Rs.\\n5,200 crores of GNPA overall is now down to about Rs. 3,300 crores which is a signiﬁcant improving on\\nthe GNPA on the book that we are seeing. ROE is also starting to step up at 4.7% and the business\\ndiversiﬁcation is well on track with both on pre-owned vehicle ﬁnancing, ﬂeet opex ﬁnancing, all that is\\nexpanding well. Capital adequacy and DE ratios and liquidity all of them comfortable. Next slide please.\\nJust ﬁnalizing on the outlook, lot of questions I see on demand. We continue to remain optimistic on\\ndemand despite those external challenges. We acknowledge those challenges but right now we are not\\nseeing that impacting our demand for our products. But we do expect to see some moderate inﬂation\\nseep through. Our H2 performance is likely to improve further, on three reasons. One, seasonality will\\nstart working in our favor, supplies are likely to improve particularly in JLR as well as in passenger vehicles\\nand in passenger vehicles a slew of new launches coming through and therefore quite conﬁdent on the\\ndeleveraging plans. I will draw your attention to the improved indication on what we are likely to land the\\nyear at in JLR likely to be more around 8% for this year and we do believe we can sustain it thereon. So\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\noverall, that is a focus and on CV side, the focus particularly on SCV market shares and continuing to\\nsustain the improvements that we are seeing in M&HCV market shares is important. We will not change\\nthe pivot to growth, pivot to quality strategy that we have put in place and double-digit EBITDA for the\\nentire year, securing that and improving it is important. And PV of course get back to market beating\\ngrowth and on EV the focus will squarely be on expanding the market and driving up the EV penetration\\nof our portfolio. That is what we have to say and now we move to questions and we see 17 questions\\nlined up. Heavy questions coming through.\\n\\nQuestions and Answers section\\nP.B. Balaji\\nSo let me start from the question that came in ﬁrst. So I request if our teams could move to the most\\nrecent tab there so that we can go right all the way down on that particular tab.\\nFirst question from Jinesh, Motilal Oswal. Richard, this is coming your way. The guidance for EBIT margins\\nincreased to 8%. However, the free cash ﬂow guidance has remained at GBP 2 billion. Should we not\\nexpect a higher FCF given EBIT is going up?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nOkay, thank you. So as we said, we closed the quarter with GBP 2.249 billion worth of net debt. So we\\nneed to generate GBP 1.25 billion or more to get down to our net debt target of sub 1 GBP billion. That is\\nGBP 500 million more than we generated in the ﬁrst half of the year. We're on track to do so, one of the\\nthings that does put a little bit of diﬀerence between EBIT and cash ﬂow is investment. Our investment in\\nthe ﬁrst half of the year was GBP 1,472 million. We do expect that to go up in the second half of the year,\\nas we start paying for the preparation works in both our plants in Halewood and in Solihull in the UK, to\\nstart producing the next generation of BEV vehicles and also in the facilities to produce the EVUs and the\\nbatteries. So, investment levels is a bit of the disconnect between the change in EBIT guidance and the\\nchange in cash guidance, but we still do have GBP 1.25 billion of debt to, uh, take down in the next six\\nmonths. We are on track to do so.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nOkay, another question from Jinesh as well. One is the increasing salience of Range Rover, Range Rover\\nSport and Defender in your order book, but your ASPs have declined for third quarter in a row. Do you\\nexpect the ASP's to decline further as mix beneﬁt starts receding? And let's answer that question then\\nwe'll come to deferred tax where there is a series of questions.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nRichard Molyneux\\nOkay, so in terms of average selling price in Q1, it was GBP 74,000. In Q2, it was GBP 71,000. Within that,\\nwe've said in Q2, we were a little bit constrained in terms of our Range Rover and Range Rover sport\\nproduction. Range Rover in particular, which is our highest transaction price vehicle, went from 18% to\\n15% of our sales mix. We do not expect that to be permanent as we bring the second body shop online\\nfor our MLA products in Solihull and as we reduce the speciﬁc constraints that we've got in terms of Range\\nRover, we would expect that trend not to continue.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nYeah. A question on tax rates Richard, I am happy to step in as needed, but let me pass it on to you. Is\\nthere further deferred tax asset pending to be recognized, and how should we look at the whole tax rate\\nfor second half and beyond?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nYes, as Balaji I think, mentioned, due to our historic position around losses, we do have an unrecognized\\ndeferred tax asset of about GBP 1 billion. We have gone through four quarters of proﬁtability, so we are\\nlooking at that, we have no conclusion as to when that could be brought back onto the balance sheet. The\\nfact that we've got such a high unrecognized DTA does add both level and volatility to our eﬀective tax\\nrate, so we would like to get that resolved at some stage.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nAnd, therefore on a long term basis Richard, how should we plan the tax rate when we model the value\\nof the company?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nTypically, I think it would be reasonable to expect somewhere between 25% and 29%.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThank you. Coming to India, Girish this is on Indian M&HCV’s. Pricing discipline has seen some dilution in\\nthe last couple of months. How do you see this evolving? And what's ailing the LCV industry? How do you\\nsee this segment evolve over the next twelve months? And then for ACE EV, what's your order book size?\\nHow are the trends in new order intake?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nGirish Wagh\\nOkay, so I think from Tata Motors, we are not seeing any drop in the pricing discipline. In fact, we continue\\nwith the discipline that we introduced during last September in a very steadfast manner and we had seen\\nsome dip in the month of May, but which I spoke about in the Q1 earnings call. After that, we have been\\nconsistently growing the market operating prices. Coming to light commercial vehicles. What is ailing? I\\nthink yes, the industry has remained ﬂat and in my view there are two things. First is, I think in terms of\\npercentage increase over the base price, this segment has seen a signiﬁcant increase when we move from\\nBS3 to BS4, then BS4 to BS6 Phase I and then BS6 Phase 1 to Phase II and as a result I think the ticket size\\nhas gone up. Comparatively, I think the freight rates have not followed to that extent and the second thing\\nI would say is I think the ﬁnancing environment, I think post COVID all the financiers have been a bit wary,\\nif I may say so and cautious and therefore all this put together is keeping this industry ﬂat. But I must say,\\nas the result of this, I think the quality of books of all the financiers has been consistently improving, at\\nleast on our counter. But we do believe in the growth potential of this segment and I think once the\\neconomics for the operators balance out, once again I think the industry will start growing. Coming to ACE\\nEV, I think your question was on PLI. Yes. As I mentioned, we have received the PLI certiﬁcate just two\\ndays back for the ACE EV. Regarding the order book, so if you recollect during the launch, we had signed\\nup with 5 customers for gradual deployment of vehicles. Out of those 5 customers, I think one customer\\nis out of operation as of now. But, we continue to deploy vehicles in rest of the four customers month\\nover month. But in addition to that, I'm very pleased to tell you that we are also seeing good traction for\\nthe ACE EV in some of the retail segments. You know and at some point of time later I can also speak\\nabout this in detail, but we see good traction happening there. Of course, range anxiety, charging\\ninfrastructure, ﬁnancing environment are some of the issues which remain in the minds of the customers,\\nwhich we are tackling by increasing the ﬁnancing period, by increasing the warranty on these vehicles,\\nand we continue to improve the charging infrastructure and I think gradually we see retails of ACE EV\\ngrowing month over month. We also are coming up with quite a few variants on ACE EV to address\\nmultiple requirements. Balaji?\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Girish. A comment on PLI's. We have got the certiﬁcates, but obviously there's a lot of scrutiny\\nfrom the authorities in terms of the capex spends, what contributes as Capex that needs to be considered.\\nSo right now we haven't got the PLI's monies yet. I think we expect - internal expectation Q4 is when it\\nshould probably come through. Let's wait and see. We are, of course, in intense conversations with the\\ngovernment on that.\\nOkay, let me go to next question,this is coming from Raghu, Nuvama Research. For JLR how do expect the\\norder book rundown -- the pace of 5000 per month that we indicated earlier? Does that continue? Any\\nother comment on that? Adrian, would you want to take that?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nAdrain Mardell\\nYes, let me take that Balaji. Look, we've consistently run down the order book by about 5000 a month,\\nnot only in our quarter two, but actually for the last nine months. We are building more cars in the second\\nhalf of the year; Richard covered that we have more production days. So I think it's reasonable to assume\\nthat the order book will fall a little bit more sharply over the next 6 months. Our intention is to get it back\\nto pre-pandemic levels, which we've referenced before, around 110,000 units and our expectation is that\\nwill happen somewhere between the end of this ﬁscal year and the start of next. So I expect a marginal\\nacceleration because we're building more cars and therefore fulﬁlling more of the existing orders.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nFrom an input cost side, given the higher wage hikes that we are seeing in suppliers like IAC, do you expect\\ninput procurement costs to go up?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nOkay, I'll take that one. We are seeing some areas where there is still inﬂation, be that wage inﬂation or\\nother cost inﬂation. But as I referenced in the charts, actually, certainly on a year by year basis, there's\\nconsiderable elements that are improving. We are spending vastly less on broker buys of chips than we\\nwere beforehand and there are many other elements in relation to commodity costs and even utility costs\\nthat are going down. So no, I don't think that is likely to be the case. In fact, I think the dynamic that you're\\ngoing to see over the coming time is that we will have to spend marginally more in terms of VME and FMI\\nin terms of order generation, but we will oﬀset those costs by reductions versus last year's levels in our\\nmaterial cost and operational costs.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Richard. I think Shailesh, Girish, let me put this to you. What would be the outlook for M&HCV and\\nPV growth for FY 2025? I think it's coming to both of you - growth outlook for next year\\nGirish Wagh\\nSo, let me take like this. M&HCV I think YoY we will see continued growth in Q3, would be almost double\\ndigit. I think Q4 could be ﬂattish or little growth because Q4 of last year was pretty good. I think talking\\nabout FY 2025 in my view, it is too early to speak about it because we have key monitorable, which is the\\ngeneral elections happening in Q1 of next year. To talk about Q1 or Q2 demand for next year of M&HCV,\\nwe'll have to wait at least for one quarter to see how the order book of the ﬂeet owners and the\\ninfrastructure builders is panning out and we will come to know something about that when we meet\\nnext quarter.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo for PV again, as Girish also mentioned, too early to really comment on that. We need to see where we\\nend this year, which is looking strong, touching 4 million or so. The base is very high. We need to\\nunderstand that the last ﬁnancial year the growth was nearly 25% and that is very diﬃcult to sustain.\\nTypically the PV industry mid-to-long term grows by at a CAGR of 6% to 7%. So, I would still imagine that\\nthe demand would remain strong but would be still a single digit in FY 2025 but I must say that it is still\\nvery speculative. These are the numbers that we see with the projections that we get from various\\nagencies. So, I think, let's see where the year ends is what I would say.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Shailesh. A question on the royalty for this. I think I would just say that these are reasonable\\nroyalties and obviously at an arm's length basis. So, that's how we would respond to that.\\nPV-EV the chargers, 7800 chargers that we have put out there, how many of them would be fast chargers?\\nWhat are the customer behavior of using them or charging at home?\\nGirish Wagh\\nI think most of these 7800 chargers, especially I'm saying are the fast chargers these are on highways. And\\nthis would be, I would say if my guess could be right, it is about 4000 to 4500 is CCS2 chargers which are\\neither 25-kilowatt or 50-kilowatt chargers. As far as the charging behavior is concerned, we clearly see\\nthrough our telematics data that more than 90% of the customers are charging their car at home. So, the\\nuse of public chargers is less. It is only being used if they are on the highway but primarily the mode of\\ncharging is the home chargers which is either a dedicated charger in the parking slot or residential welfare\\nassociation common chargers which are provided.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nNext question coming from Hitesh Goel. I think Richard this is coming your way. How are you seeing the\\nJaguar portfolio? Will you run down Jaguar in calendar year 2024 second half before Jaguar Electric is\\nlaunched? And does this mean major savings on JLR EBITDA? How do you see the Jaguar transition?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nSo, look, Jaguar is still performing strongly. We sold nearly 25,000 Jaguars in the ﬁrst half of the year. Yes,\\nwe will wind the production of the current cars down as we move to the new fully electric Jaguar, which,\\nas you know, we're saying is a copy of nothing. It is nothing like the existing set of Jaguar cars. So we don't\\nreally want those to overlap. We haven't been speciﬁc as to exactly when we're going to end each vehicle\\nbecause some of them are built in Castle Bromwich, some of them are built in Solihull, some of them are\\nbuilt in Austria. So it will vary by plant but it is reasonably safe to assume that we will run those down\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nbefore we launch the entirely new all electric copy of nothing Jaguar. In terms of the impact that, that will\\nhave on our EBITDA, yes, we're anticipating that new Jaguar will be a really proﬁtable business. So it will\\nbe part of our growth plan of EBITDA and EBIT as we go forward, as we move from the old Jaguar to the\\nnew.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks, Richard. Next question. Probably one of the most eagerly awaited question is Shailesh coming\\nyour way. This is from Gunjan, Bank of America. Can you talk about the EV outlook in India? There's been\\nsome pause in momentum. So can you talk about the pace of adoption that we see now and what are the\\nkey drivers for stepping it up?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah, Balaji, this is a question which in the last one month I would have been asked by multiple people. I\\ncompletely understand where this is coming from, some of the negative articles which have come on this,\\nbut if you really see the facts, in H1, we have seen a growth of 107% in EVs. For us it has been about 76%.\\nSo it is very strong I would say. There has been a quarter on quarter decline and impact, primarily because\\none, if you remember, there were several launches which happened in the EV industry in the late quarter\\nfour of last ﬁnancial year, quarter one of this ﬁnancial year and you know that whenever there is a launch,\\nthere is a spike in the demand and there is a ﬁlling of the channel with supplies for those new models and\\nthen you see it stabilizing at lower levels. That is the phenomena that you are seeing in quarter two that's\\nnumber one.\\nNumber two, remember that Nexon EV has been one of the highest selling models in the EV industry and\\nI covered in the presentation, Balaji also spoke about that we had to ramp down the volumes of Nexon\\nEV because of the transition to the new model and therefore it impacted in the quarter two. The Third\\nimpact I also covered in the presentation is that Telangana, which is nearly 10% to 15% of the EV industry,\\nthe road tax waiver was taken away. It is not because it has been taken away, the demand came down\\nbut in anticipation that it will be reverted, it still remains down. I would say these were the three big\\nfactors why you have seen quarter on quarter, but these are not structural reasons, right. Now, coming\\nto mid to long term, what will be the EV outlook where the drivers of growth are going to come from?\\nSee, the biggest opportunity I see is that 75% of the sales of EVs today is coming from only 25 cities. So all\\nthe manufacturers, including us being the market leader, are yet to expand into the larger part of the\\ncountry where there is a huge demand which is lying there.\\nSecond, I would say that we are already seeing announcement of multiple EVs by diﬀerent players. And\\nremember that whenever there is a new price point or a new body style that you oﬀer in the market,\\nthere is all of a sudden jump. And let me elaborate what I'm saying. Just take Tiago EV. Before Tiago EV\\ngot launched every quarter, the industry used to sell about 14,000 to 15,000. After Tiago, EV got launched,\\nit moved up to 25,000 because it was a new price point that you brought into the market. In the coming\\nquarters and years, you are going to see EVs covering the entire spectrum of price range, which is going\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nto really increase the volumes signiﬁcantly I would say that's the second big driver and the third one is the\\ncharging infra. We all know that the biggest impediment to the growth of EV has been the charging infra.\\nAnd the very fact that 93% of the people are charging at home also signiﬁes that people are right now\\ncomfortable driving in the cities but there's drastic increase in public charging, which we are anticipating\\nespecially on the highways in the next 2 years or so. This will unleash the mainstream customers because\\ntoday it is early adopter or early majority which is buying. A mainstream buyer will only buy when they\\nget the comfort on the highways and why I'm saying that it is going to drastically increase because see,\\nnumber one would be the oil marketing companies. I'm not even talking about Tata Power which also has\\nan aggressive plan and there are certain CPOs also who are going very aggressive. But oil marketing\\ncompanies have Rs. 800 crore of subsidy provided by the government to put 22,000 chargers on the\\nhighways by 2024. And this is going to really signiﬁcantly provide us tailwind to tap to the mainstream\\nbias, so I think mid to long term and in the coming quarters you will see EV growing very strong.\\n\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Shailesh. PLI we already answered about the status of PLI. Maybe another question coming your\\nway and Adrian, feel free to chip in if anything Shailesh missed. The whole signiﬁcance of this platform\\nsharing with JLR on the EMA side for the AVINYA range of products.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nI think this is a very signiﬁcant development you are already aware that we had showcased AVINYA in\\nAuto Expo also and prior to that one year back, we had unveiled it for the ﬁrst time. This is the ﬁrst time\\nthat we will be entering into the premium e-SUV segment and we evaluated multiple platforms, including\\ndoing a grounds up skateboard ourselves. But when we got the opportunity to evaluate EMA, we thought\\nthat while our positioning is going to be diﬀerent than JLR positioning, but this unleashes a big opportunity\\nfor us to access state of the art features. The new age features which we'll be requiring in the coming\\nyears, which comes from the electrical/ electronic architecture and a very mature platform which has\\nbeen developed by JLR, which will really improve the reliability, predictability, future readiness of this\\nplatform. So this is a big game to us to position ourselves on a very strong pedigree of JLR EMA platform\\nso that's number one.\\nNumber two is that the two companies have an opportunity to really derive the synergies on the cost side.\\nCertain parts we will be unique, we'll be localizing ourselves, so that will give us the cost advantage. But\\nthat also gives the opportunity to JLR to also tap some of those cost beneﬁts. But at the same time, when\\nit comes to the high tech components, I think JLR negotiating power with the supplier also beneﬁts us. So\\nit's a beneﬁt on both the sides. So cost becomes a big game and most importantly, given the maturity of\\nthe platform, it also helps us reduce the time. So, we see multiple beneﬁts of working together. And for\\nus particularly, I think we will bring a very premium electric SUV which will be on a very strong pedigree\\nof JLR platform.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nP.B. Balaji\\nAdrian, anything to add from your side on this?\\nAdrain Mardell\\nAgree with all of those three things and I think the only thing I'd like to add is we've talked for at least four\\nyears about the increasing collaboration between JLR and the broader Tata group and I think with the\\nannouncements in July around Agratas, and now this announcement hopefully everybody listening is\\nstarting to understand the power of that relationship which will continue going forward and I'm sure grow\\nbeyond the levels we've announced already. So, I'm delighted with the progress in the last six months to\\ntwelve months that we've made as a group.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThank you. Another ﬂavor of the question, maybe Richard, this coming your way. Can you refresh any\\nview to the 10% EBIT margin that you've given for FY 2026 given that you have updated the guidance for\\nthe current year to 8%?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nNo. There's no change in our guidance that we will get to double digit margins FY 2026.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks. Yeah. Okay, next question I think there are two or three ﬂavors of the question, Girish, coming\\nyour way. The M&HCV market share gain that you're currently seeing, can you give more color to it?\\nWhere is this coming from? Why do you think you're winning? And this is likely to sustain?\\nGirish Wagh\\nOkay, so I think in M&HCV and for that matter, I would say the entire truck segment, which I'm including\\nICVs also, our focus has been to improve the value proposition consistently, right because ﬁnally,\\nwhatever we are selling has to make sense for the customer, right. I mean, while we are looking at it as\\nmore of discount reduction, VME reduction, I think it is more about improving the value being delivered\\nto the customers. So in the value delivered to the customer, let me talk about the product, I think our\\nposition and our strategy on consistently improving the product at every emission compliance or\\nregulatory gate has been vindicated. So we improved the TCO signiﬁcantly in BS6 Phase I, we did that\\nagain in BS6 Phase II, and I think in Q1, as the products got established and with lot of back to back trials,\\nI think the TCO improvement got established, which therefore led to good value improvement for the\\ncustomer.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nIn addition to that, I think we've also given higher performance or higher power to weight ratio, which\\nalso I spoke about in the last quarter. I think that is also leading to very good traction, especially in the\\nTipper segment. In addition to that, I think over the years we have improved our service oﬀerings\\nsigniﬁcantly so, we have a very attractive annual maintenance contract and I think in the BS6 electronic\\nera, the annual maintenance contract is also making signiﬁcant diﬀerence along with the key account\\nengagement that we have put in place. Finally, I think I must add that ﬂeet edge now is also helping the\\ncustomers to actually accrue value in real life usage of the vehicles and this is clearly becoming a\\ndiﬀerentiator in the marketplace, especially in the cargo segment and in a diﬀerent manner in the tipper\\nsegment. So, I think all these put together, therefore it's a strong value proposition for the customers.\\nAnd you also asked about what we will do for the future. I think we will stay committed to this with every\\nmodel year as we call in trucks and as also with every regulatory change, I think we will continue to\\nimprove the value proposition for the customer.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Girish. Sorry, this question came, the M&HCV question came from Abhinav and I remember Kapil\\nalso asked this question earlier, another question from Abhinav on the PV festive sales. How do you see\\nit performing, how's market demand?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah, so when I talk about Navaratra, especially, even the last Navaratra was very strong for us. We\\nalready had a very high base but very happy to share that we saw nearly 30% growth in the last, what to\\nsay 15 days or so which has passed since the start of Navaratra in terms of registration and 16% growth\\nin terms of delivery. So it has been a very strong festive period for us on the back of new launches, success\\nof CNG.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nYes, thanks. Next question from Chandramouli, Goldman Sachs, some of those questions have already\\nbeen answered. I'll just pick up the ones that are not yet answered. Again Shailesh to your side what are\\nthe initial trends on the new Nexon versus the old Nexon? How are orders picking up?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nVery strong, very strong response to Nexon. As I said, that three months to four months of waiting period\\ndepending on the variant. But as far as EVs is also concerned, these are like 2 times to 3 times increase in\\nthe booking rates as compared to the normal times. But we'll have to then see in the next one month or\\ntwo months how this volume stabilizes but excellent response to both the products.\\nP.B. Balaji\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nGreat. Again, staying with you, the EV margins, what are the key contributors for the quarter on quarter\\nimprovement in that margins?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYes, I think there are at least four factors underlying that. Number one is the cell cost reduction which we\\nhave already seen about 15% to 20% and we are going to see further reduction of signiﬁcant amount I\\nwould say in the quarter three also and going forward we are also optimistic. Then we have also the non\\ncell cost reduction which is pack minus cell items and a lot of these items were imported. But as we been\\nworking on the PLI, there is a lot of localization action which has happened, which is another source of\\ncost reduction that we have seen. The third is also the use of new generation and compact aggregates\\nwhen we launch for example when Nexon EV was launched, we shifted to the new generation power\\nelectronics as well as some of the aggregates which really helped us in not only improving the\\nperformance eﬃciency but also cost. And the last one would be there's a massive cost reduction program\\nwhich is also going into PV side so, the donor vehicle cost reduction actions on that side has also beneﬁted\\nso these would be the four factors.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThank you, I think question Girish, coming your way. Price hikes that you have announced in October, can\\nyou give us a sense of what magnitude it is and how do you see the raw material environment? Maybe\\nyou can combine the two?\\nGirish Wagh\\nYeah yes, Balaji. So see, I think we should also look at this in a context, right. And as I mentioned sometime\\nback, since last September we had not taken any price increase, right which is the list price increase. There\\nwas no price increase whatsoever for more than 12 months right and this is despite the inﬂationary\\nenvironment that one saw on the commodities and especially steel and precious metals, right. The entire\\njourney during these 12 months was about realization improvement. Now, in the month of October after\\none year we have taken a list price increase and we will pass-through this price increase gradually during\\nthis quarter and we are already on track for that. In terms of commodity environment, as I spoke, I think\\nwe are looking at some headwind on the steel, right, and we are keeping a close watch on that. There\\ncould be some impact on precious metals but that is more for petrol engine vehicles so the impact on CV\\nwill be lesser.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Girish. Richard, Adrian, this is coming again a very thematic question coming in, in terms of\\nslowdown in global markets. A couple of course asked them do you agree that it will slow down? But let\\nme leave it to you to answer that. Are there any visible signs and due to this also the EV penetration\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nslowdown, many OEMs are pushing out their launches. What is your perspective? And in order to\\nturbocharge demand in this slowing down environment, how much of VME/FME rise can happen? How\\nwill you plan to manage this?\\nAdrain Mardell\\nYes. So, there is a slowdown which we see in some markets. I shouldn't say too much about other OEMs\\nbecause obviously I'm not close to their particular circumstances, but with the levels of discounting that\\nhappening, it generally only happens when supplies signiﬁcantly over levels of natural demand. So. I\\nsuspect that's one of the causes behind much of that discounting. Interest rates clearly are very high a lot\\nof the incentive deals are underpinning those interest rates, 8% in the US which a lot of the OEMs are\\nsubventing and we're not right. So, I think the big point here is there's a huge diﬀerentiation between our\\npositioning in the marketplace, their VME in the 1 percentage plus level compared to others. And the big\\nreason for that still, of course, is back to the earlier discussion. We have a huge amount of pent up\\ndemand, which we're slowly, slowly working through, and a huge capability to increase incentives and be\\nsigniﬁcantly lower than in the marketplace going forward in FY 2025, which we will look to do as we close\\nout the balance of this year. So I think we're in a really healthy place, a really good place in a very, very\\ndiﬃcult market, but we're very wary about the diﬃculties in the marketplace as well. So our intention is\\nto stay in front of the problem here.\\n\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThank you Adrian. The next question comes from Nishit Jalan, on the PV business a lot of those questions\\nhave been answered, maybe one speciﬁc one, I would say, has there been any production constraint as\\ndispatches appear to be lower in the last two months and when do we start the production in the Sanand\\nplant and when should we expect Curvv and Sierra?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo, as far as last two months is concerned, I think last month we were the highest ever in terms of oﬀtake.\\nSo that was the highest production month for us. But still, we lost opportunity because it was the ﬁrst\\nmonth of ramp up of Harrier and Safari, so we could not fully produce what we would have intended to.\\nA month prior to that again, it was also a month of signiﬁcant ramp down of Harrier and Safari and some\\nof the models in, say, compact sedan and hatches so that's been the case, but I think exit number is more\\nimportant, which has been the highest ever. The second question was Balaji, on Curvv right? So Curvv and\\nSierra. So Curvv and Sierra is planned to be launched in 2024 and 2025 respectively. And as far as Sanand\\nis concerned, so that's also slated for in ﬁrst half of 2024.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks Shailesh. Question on Freight TIger, this is from Pramod Amthe InCred. What are the transaction\\nvaluation and the burn rate and the funding needed for the next two, three years? See the way the\\ntransaction has been structured, if you recollect, we had paid about Rs.150 crores for a 26 point some\\npercent stake. That values business at roughly about Rs. 420 crores so that's a transaction valuation. And\\nwe also know over the next two years, three years, whatever the cash burn is there, we're estimating\\nroughly about Rs. 100 crores will burn in that and therefore that is what we are ready with the funding\\nfor that as well. So that business is well funded and ready to meet its objectives and we obviously will\\nwant to work closely between Freight Tiger and Fleet Edge to ensure we drive maximum synergies and\\nthose synergistic business cases and how that can in turn manage this burn rate and step up growth rates\\nis something that we'll be working with them in the coming days.\\nNext question from Kapil Singh, Indian PV some of your competition has seen sharp clearance of order\\nbooks. How is it in your case for the various ICE, EVs and CNGs?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo you know, it was very much expected because the order book was being created prior to the festive\\nseason and festive season has released most of them for competition and in general for the industry, I\\nwould say. In our portfolio, I would say for certain models, the regular models, of course, we have also\\nseen the depletion of the order book in the festive period because it was the phase of delivery and we are\\nre-working on creating fresh orders. But it has been more than oﬀset I would say, with the new launches\\nthat we had in the last two months. Harrier, Safari, Nexon so it's pretty balanced, I would say.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nAnd therefore how do you see the PV volume run rates in the second half?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo, second half as Balaji, you also mentioned in your presentation that it should be strong on the back of\\nlaunches that we had and which we will have in the coming quarters.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nYeah, Auto PLI, this coming from Nishit again, auto PLI as I said earlier, Q4 is when we are expecting to see\\nthe cash starting to come through but let's wait for that and then we should be there. But everybody\\naround, all stakeholders committed to make it happen so let's wait for that.\\nAshish Jain, Macquaire next one, Richard this is coming your way. When do we see the JLR working capital\\ncycle reverse given the GBP 1.4 billion build that we saw in FY 2022-23?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nRichard Molyneux\\nSo we will see some of that reverse during the second half of this year. Our working capital cycle tends to\\nimprove as our volumes improve. So, some of that will reverse through the next six months and it's part\\nof our delivery of our GBP 1.25 billion of operating cash.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nThanks. Next one coming from Pramod, UBS, battery plant. Can you please share the status of the battery\\nplants?\\nIn July we announced the UK tie up for setting up a battery plant there and India is also on schedule at\\nthis point in time on the internal plans. Obviously you should expect to hear more on these plants in the\\ncoming days. So wait for the news for the same piece.\\nIndia same from Pramod, India EV arm, do you have any update on fundraising? Currently there are no\\nplans for fundraise on EV arm and therefore -- and how we are placed on Capex funding for this business?\\nAbsolutely secured the Rs. 7500 Crore that came through from TPG secures 50% of the 2 billion funding\\nthen PLI is the other one. So between the two, we are well funded.\\nLet's give me a minute please. I think Safari and Harrier is already answered so let me leave that out. Can\\nyou detail out the PLI beneﬁt is restricted to Capex spending.\\nLot of questions on trying to understand PLI beneﬁt, Shailesh if you want to give it a try ﬁrst and I go next.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nI think you have covered it Balaji.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nNo, no, no it's mentioned what is this PLI beneﬁt all about? Okay, let me start, you can chip in. There are\\nthree aspects to the PLI that is there. Number one, there is a threshold Capex is about Rs. 120 crores which\\nwe comfortably meet and then there is a target Capex that need to be spent which is about Rs. 2,000\\ncrores. Anything is Rs. 2,000 crores spent over the Rs. 120 crores is treated as eligibility for a PLI beneﬁt\\nnumber one. Number two, there has to be a 50% localization that needs to happen other than batteries.\\nSo that, that is what the ARAI certiﬁcation is all about going through the entire space there and this Capex\\nhas to be eligible Capex on speciﬁc areas. It's not like any and all Capex there.\\nThen once you're eligible for this, you get a beneﬁt anywhere from 13% to 18% of the EV sales that you\\ndo which the legal entities are already precleared with the authorities. So this is the construct of the PV\\nsetup. Right now we have got the ARAI certiﬁcation conﬁrming 50% compliance, 50% localization for Tiago\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nNovember 2, 2023\\n\\nand ACV EV and the reason we did not put the Nexon because the new Nexon has just been launched so\\ntherefore we would rather take because it's quite an elaborate process of getting it right. So we will now\\nbe putting up Nexon for approval then the respective new brands will also come on to it.\\nSo, we are conﬁdent of getting the DVA requirement and once this is there then obviously they scrutinize\\nyou for understanding did you meet all the eligible Capex and that tick oﬀ is currently underway once that\\nis done then you are eligible for PLI. Your EV sales has to be authorized by the statutory auditor of yours\\ncertiﬁcation given to IFC. IFC is the one that approves these numbers and then the Ministry of Heavy\\nIndustry makes the payment on that. This is the process. Obviously I may have missed a few steps in this\\nbut by and large this is what it is.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nIf there are any supplier claims so then that is oﬀset.\\nP.B. Balaji\\nAny supplier who claims on that will be oﬀset against you. So this is the broad scheme Hitesh. What else?\\nPramod, JLR ﬁrst half margin- is the full year guidance conservative, we've already talked about so let me\\nskip that. I think we are now coming to an end of all the questions, right? Just give us a minute, please, in\\ncase there's anything we are missing. Sanand plant, Kapil Singh. Sanand plant, can this cause a dip in PV\\nbusiness margin? What are the optimum volume at which it will not be margin dilutive and by which when\\nyou can already reach it? I think Kapil, these costs are already in my P&L, because the factory has been\\nbought over when? Early January and therefore this cost is already in our P&L therefore nothing to talk\\nabout there. And our volumes are anyway picking up. If you recollect, we sold 48,000 last month, our max\\ncapacities will stretch up to 55,000. So we are already at absolutely at a limit in terms of our capacities\\nhence this is only going to add as volumes pick up.\\nI think, with this. No – here's Gautam from B&K securities. Do you feel the biggest impediment to EV\\ngrowth is absence of secondhand EV market? Very interesting question. You want to pick that up?\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nI think you know, it is an important aspect, but I would not say that this is the biggest impediment. There\\nare other barriers and roadblocks to adoption as far as mainstream buyers are concerned and talked\\nabout it, but this is an important aspect. Frankly, when we talk about the early adopters, they really\\ndon't worry too much about this. But also you know that we launched Nexon EV, which is the Nexon EV\\nPrime with the low range in Jan 2020. So still a lot of this is not in supply. So once it comes in supply,\\nthen we'll be able to assess the market for this.

              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThank you. Firstly, thanks everybody for joining this session. I think this is one particular topic that has\\nbeen raised with us in multiple forums and multiple times. And we have always had a challenge in terms\\nof how to go about cracking this, given the various rules, regulations of the scheme, of how the original\\nshares were put together, what our Articles of Association allowed us to do it, as well as what the SEBI\\nrules were, tax implication. There's a lot of issues that were there. And I think today we bring in front of\\nyou a pretty comprehensive set of actions that have been agreed with the Board, and the Board has\\nactually approved this NCLT scheme of arrangement. And the person who has been working on this\\ntirelessly has been Dhiman. And I want him to take you through the facets of the scheme for about 10 odd\\nminutes. And then we will open up a Q&A that you may have. Dhiman, over to you.\\nDhiman Gupta\\nThank you, Balaji. As Sneha mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have a couple of slides here to walk\\nyou through the intricacies of the transaction. And then, we have a 15 to 20 minute Q&A before we start\\nour usual results call at 6:30. Just starting off on this entire proposal, as you know, Tata Motors, one of\\nthe few companies had three classes of shares outstanding. We had ADRs outstanding on NYSE. We had\\nordinary shares listed on BSE, NSE, and then we had the DVRs listed on the Indian Stock Exchanges. In\\nNovember last year, you would recollect, we announced our intention of delisting the ADRs from NYSE.\\nThat process got completed in January 2023, about six months back. Today, our Board has announced or\\napproved an NCLT scheme of arrangement, which will cancel all our “A” ordinary shares and in\\nconsideration for such a capital reduction, we will be issuing ordinary shares to all our “A” ordinary\\nshareholders. The consideration for this transaction has been set as such: for every 10 “A” ordinary shares,\\n“A” ordinary shareholders will be getting seven ordinary shares as consideration. What does it mean? It\\nmeans that the “A” ordinary shares have been valued almost at a 23% premium to yesterday's closing\\nprice, which is a substantial premium that is being offered. And second is this ratio implies that the “A”\\nordinary shares are being valued at a 30% discount to ordinary shares, compared to the 43% discount that\\nwas prevailing in the market yesterday, and significantly better than almost a 50% discount, average\\ndiscount that it has traded as over the last five years. What does it do for the shareholders as a whole? It\\nwill lead to a reduction in the overall capital base of the company, making it 4% EPS accretive for all\\nshareholders. It will eliminate the discount in Tata Motor’s overall market capitalization by almost Rs.\\n15,000 crore, which will lead to substantial value creation if TML shares are used as a currency for any\\nfurther future capital raise or any other transaction. It's a complete cashless transaction. There is no cash\\noutgo, and neither does it impact our net debt or alter our nil auto net debt targets that we have set for\\nourselves. It's being done through an NCLT scheme of arrangement subject to various regulatory\\napprovals and shareholder approvals. I'll cover that in a bit. And it is likely to take almost 12 months to 15\\nmonths for completion. At the end of this transaction, along with the ADRs that we have already delisted,\\nwe will end up significantly simplifying, streamlining, and consolidating our share capital, and we will only\\nhave ordinary shares listed on NSE and BSE. Next Slide please.\\nA little bit in terms of the context of the DVR’s and the reason and the rationale for this transaction. These\\nDVR’s were issued almost 15 years back in 2008. They were issued at a 10% discount to the then prevailing\\nordinary share prices. They carried 1/10 of voting right and entitled the DVR holders to receive 5% higher\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\ndividends. This was done in 2008. Along with Tata Motors, there were a couple of handful other\\ncompanies who came up with DVR issuances. Most of those companies have now become defunct and\\nTata Motors is the only large corporate which has this instrument outstanding. In 2009, SEBI amended its\\nregulation which did not permit Companies to issue such instruments in future, which carried either\\ndifferential voting rights or dividends and hence the kind of market for this instrument never evolved. The\\ndiscount in the “A” ordinary shares, which were listed initially at a 10% discount, kept increasing. You can\\nsee the table below how it has trended, since it was issued. For over the entire 15 years, the average\\ndiscount is about 43%, which is where it kind of closed yesterday, and in between, in the last five years,\\nthree years, last 12 months, the average discount itself has been around 50%. We have been approached\\nby shareholders multiple times in the past, to take certain actions, which can help support the price. We've\\ndone a QIP issuance in 2010, a further rights issue in 2015, to improve the liquidity of the DVR’s on the\\nstock exchanges. And, we've also kind of got it included in the index and the F&O segment, but it’s not\\nreally helped and the significant discount and undervaluation in Tata Motors market cap has continued.\\nNext Slide please.\\nYeah, so the proposed scheme as I mentioned is being done through a NCLT scheme of arrangement and\\nthe consideration that is being offered to the “A” shareholders is 7 ordinary shares for every 10 “A”\\nordinary shares, or you can say in a way it's 0.7 ordinary shares for every “A” ordinary share. What's the\\ntaxation impact of the shareholders? It's a capital reduction, which is different from a merger transaction.\\nSo, even though the consideration is being in a non-cash form, it is going to be taxable in the hands of the\\nshareholders. So, capital gains tax will be applicable depending on the shareholder's tax status and\\nresident status. Further, the distribution of the shares by Tata Motors to the shareholders will be treated\\nas a deemed dividend, and there will be certain withholding taxes on those deemed dividends as is\\napplicable in the case of a normal dividend. The scheme will also call for formation of a trust, which is to\\nbe managed by an independent trustee. The role of the trust would be to receive all the ordinary shares\\nthat are being issued to the “A” ordinary shareholders as consideration for this transaction. The trust will\\nthen will appoint a merchant banker to sell such number of shares in the market through a block deal to\\nrealize the cash to settle the withholding tax liabilities that Tata Motors has towards the deemed dividend\\nand any other, and the capital gains withholding tax for non-resident shareholders. And, the rest of the\\nshares on a net basis will be distributed or credited to the Demat account of all the “A” ordinary\\nshareholders as per their holding in the company. As I mentioned, this requires various level of approvals.\\nIt requires the approval of SEBI and stock exchanges, and once we have the SEBI and stock exchange\\napproval, it goes to NCLT. As part of the NCLT process, we will be taking 75% approval from “A” ordinary\\nshareholders as well as 75% approval of ordinary shareholders. And since the promoter Tata Sons also has\\na small shareholding holding in “A” ordinary shares, and shares will be issued to them, we will also be\\ntaking a majority of minority of the shareholders for the scheme to go through. We also require approval\\nof creditors, obviously, since it's a non-cash transaction, we don't see too much of an issue. And then\\nfinally, NCLT approvals and all the other approvals are available. In terms of, the proposal for the capital\\nreduction consideration of 0.7 or 7 ordinary shares for every 10 “A” ordinary shares, we had PWC go\\nthrough, who are the registered values for this transaction. And then, we had two merchant banks giving\\na fairness opinion from the perspective of both “A” ordinary shares and ordinary shares. So we had\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nCitibank giving the opinion for “A” ordinary shares, and we had Axis Capital doing it for ordinary\\nshareholders. Next Slide, please.\\nYeah, in terms of impact on TML share capital, this table kind of runs you through, what is the share capital\\nbase of Tata Motors, both for DVRs and ordinary shares, pre-transaction and post-transaction. I am not\\ngoing to read out all the numbers here. Any clarifications, we're happy to take it offline. But given that\\nthere is 0.7 ordinary shares issued for every “A” ordinary share, the overall capital base goes down by\\nabout Rs. 15 crore, which means that there is a 4.2% value accretion or EPS accretion for all the\\nshareholders. And, second is the voting rights of the public shareholders goes up by 3%, and that of the\\npromoters goes down from 45.8% to 42.6%. Next slide, please.\\nYeah, in a nutshell, kind of we believe this proposal is a balanced one and is beneficial to all the\\nstakeholders of Tata Motors. On one hand, we have the “A” ordinary shareholders, where the DVR shares\\nhistorically have traded at a deep discount because the market of that has not really evolved, the 30%\\ndiscount that is proposed is, significantly better than what the historical trends have been. What it also\\ndoes is, historically, the ordinary share capital has been higher and the liquidity of ordinary shares is much\\nbetter. So the “A” ordinary shareholders moving to ordinary shareholder base will get much more liquidity\\nfor their shares. And it's a non-cash transaction. So the “A” ordinary shareholders continue to benefit from\\nthe upsides or the growth story of Tata Motors even in future. They don't have to relinquish their\\nshareholding. For ordinary shares, their economic rights are not impacted at all, but they benefit from the\\n4% EPS accretion that this transaction delivers. It increases the free float of ordinary shares by 18%, so\\nthere's much more liquidity and, it enhances the public shareholder voting rights by 3%. From a Tata\\nMotors perspective, it's a culmination of the journey that we've been taking in terms of simplifying our\\nshare capital base. So, with the ADRs delisted and the “A” ordinary shareholding being capital reduced in\\nlieu of ordinary shares, we completely consolidate all our trading into ordinary shares, which is what most\\nIndian companies do. We increase our market capitalization, remove the steep discount because of the\\n“A” ordinary shares, cash neutral transaction and no impact on our net debt - NIL auto net debt targets.\\nNext slide.\\nYes. So, I see a couple of questions kind of coming through on the chat box. We will have another 15\\nminutes to take additional questions that you might have. Post that we'll kind of continue with our results\\ncall. Anything, questions pending we will take at the end of the session or our IR teams will revert to you.\\nYes, maybe what – we will just cover or summarize the taxation impact of this transaction, and also the\\ntrust structure. Anish, can you?\\nYes. So, we've got a slide in the annexure on the taxation impact of the transaction. I'll encourage all of\\nyou to go through it separately. We can clarify something offline. But as I said, this will be a taxable\\ntransaction in the hands of “A” ordinary shareholders. And the company will be withholding the applicable\\nwithholding taxes for each “A” shareholders will be deducted by the company. And the shares will be\\ncredited to each holder's account on a net basis. So, what are the taxation impacts that will come, that\\nthe company will be deducting? One is, the distribution of ordinary shares, it will be treated as a deemed\\ndividend. So, there will be a withholding tax on that deemed dividend, basis the applicable tax rate on the\\nvarious residency of the shareholders. The tables for such withholding rates are indicated in the table\\nbelow. For non-resident holders specifically, law requires the company to withhold the gains on the capital\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\ngains, so we will be doing that for the non-resident shareholders, which is about 2% of our overall\\nshareholding base. When the trust sells the shares on the stock exchange to recover the withholding taxes,\\nif there is any gain on the shares from the time of issue to the time they are sold, they will be deducted.\\nShort-term withholding tax will be deducted. And then, other standards, securities tax, brokerage tax, etc,\\nwill apply. The point to note is that the deemed dividend that applies onto the company, the shareholders\\nwill be getting a credit in the capital gains tax. And whatever withholding taxes we are deducting, the\\nshareholders will be issued certificates against those withholding tax, so that they can offset it against the\\ntaxes that need to be paid at their end. Yeah, next slide.\\nWe've got a schematic on how the trust is being put together to effect the withholding taxes that need\\nto be deducted. So Tata Motors will be the settler of the trust. We will incorporate the trust and we will\\nbe funding the trust to take care of the initial setup cost. The independent trustees will be appointed by\\nTata Motors and they will be responsible to execute the purpose of the trust through a trust deed. It will\\ninvolve the trust to receive all the shares, the ordinary shares, forming part of the transaction\\nconsideration. The trustees will appoint a merchant bank who will compute the number of shares to be\\nsold to recover the withholding tax liabilities on a per shareholder basis, through a sale of shares on the\\nstock market. Once these liabilities, withholding tax liabilities are either, transferred to Tata Motors to\\npay to the income tax or directly to the income tax government, the balance cash consideration, the\\nbalance shares on the net basis will be issued to the shareholders along with any surplus cash for fractional\\nentitlement, etc., will also be distributed directly to the shareholders. The trust will be set up prior to the\\neffective date once the approvals of the shareholders, etc. are received.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nSo, if you want to take a question on this, Dhiman, I think there are a few questions on the line.\\nDhiman Gupta\\nYes.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nWhen will this cancellation of “A” ordinary shares, let me just publish this question. Just give us a minute,\\nplease. So, will the number of shares issued to “A” ordinary shareholders differ depending on the tax\\nliability for each category of investors, like mutual fund, individual NRI, and how do you intend to manage\\nit?\\nDhiman Gupta\\nYes, so the consideration that is going to be issued by Tata Motors will not change. So, the ratio will still\\nbe 0.7. So, at a Tata Motors level, what is issued to the trust doesn't change. The trust then decides the\\nnumber of shares that it needs to sell to recover the withholding tax liabilities, bases the tax residencies\\nof each and every shareholder. And as you see from the table, the withholding tax liabilities are different\\nfor different classes. So for domestic shareholders, it's 10%. Domestic shareholders form above 30% of\\nour shareholding base in “A” ordinary shareholders. You have mutual funds and insurance companies, the\\nwithholding tax liability is 0%. You have FPIs at 17%, and then for NRIs, it's slightly higher, who are about\\n2% of our capital base. So yes, you are right from a Tata Motors perspective, the number of shares which\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nare issued doesn't change, but the net that is received by the shareholders post the trust selling shares to\\nrecover the withholding tax liabilities will differ.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYeah. Okay, thanks. Another one is, when will this be operational? When will the cancellation of “A”\\nordinary shares and issue of ordinary shares be done? Any timeline?\\nDhiman Gupta\\nYeah, so, there are a host of steps that we need to go through before we reach that. As I explained, we\\nfirst need the SEBI NOC approval, post that we will be filing a petition with NCLT to admit the scheme. We\\nthen go to an EGM, where it needs to be approved by the requisite majority of shareholders. Post that,\\nwe need various other approvals from NCLT. We expect this to take anywhere between 12 to 15 months.\\nOnce the NCLT approval is received, and we file the scheme with the ROC, the scheme becomes effective.\\nAnd the shareholders who are holders of “A” ordinary shares on the record date that is determined by\\nthe Board of the Company after the NCLT approvals are received, their shares will get extinguished and\\nordinary shares will get issued in lieu of that. So yes, it would be about 12 to 15 months.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nOkay. Fair enough. And second question is, so what happens in between if share prices changes? No\\nimpact at all because the consideration has been fixed today.\\nDhiman Gupta\\nYeah. So it's not a cash consideration. It's a relative ratio. So, irrespective of how the “A” ordinary shares\\ntrade from here on, the ratio of 7 ordinary shares for 10 “A” ordinary shares doesn't change.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nOkay. So, I think two questions coming on both from Pramod and Rakesh on the how did you arrive at a\\n30% discount versus the 40% to 50% that's currently as shown in the PPT and also what the market has\\nbeen trending. Can you throw some light?\\nDhiman Gupta\\nYes. So, interesting question. I think, probably the most challenging part of this equation, I think the\\nvaluers, PWC, who were the valuers to this transaction and Citi and Axis who were the fairness opinion,\\nthey put various angles on this number. I think at one hand, the perspective was that the “A” ordinary and\\nordinary shareholders have the same economic rights, they have the same liquidation rights, other than\\nthe voting rights, which are different. And for the voting rights, they were issued at a 10% discount\\noriginally. And, on the other hand, for various market factors, the DVRs have traded at a deep, deep\\ndiscount of 50% or 40% and various other numbers, which is the other reality. I think they have given\\nweightage to both facets of the equation. And they've given different weightages, I guess, the market\\nfactor is a reality, the economic equality was a reality at the time of issue. And basis their perception on\\nwhat the relative weightage for these factors were, they have arrived at a 30% discount.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nP. B. Balaji\\nFair enough. I think one more question in terms of what will be the issue price to the trust?\\nActually, that may not be relevant because you're going to issue seven ordinary shares in lieu of the 10\\n“A” ordinary shares that are being canceled. So therefore, there's no price implication at this point in time.\\nIt's a differential, it's a proportion to what the ordinary to “A” ordinary number is. That's what is more\\nrelevant, which is already being fixed now. And I think the record date, a lot of questions related to the\\nprocess. All I can say is that at this point in time, we are getting into submitting the schemes in the NCLT\\nover the next 15 days, that's priority one. And there's enough time between now and by the time the\\nNCLT final process comes for us to engage again and again. But, since it's a significant event, we thought\\nwe will come upfront about it and talk to all of you today about it. I think with this, let's probably wind up\\nthe questions related to DVRs and move on to the results presentation, please. Can you put it up, Anish?\\nOkay. Thanks to all of you for joining the session on the results piece. On the Safe Harbor statement, I will\\njust draw your attention of one accounting policy change that is coming through from a JLR IFRS\\nperspective. This does not impact consolidated results. It only impacts JLR IFRS numbers, where grant\\naccounting, which they had earlier done on net basis is now moving into gross basis. And that accounting\\nis having an impact on the EBITDA numbers which is being called out in the respective slides. Nothing\\nmaterial there, but something that’s just a call out here. Next slide, please.\\nA set of series of actions that are coming in there. Big one in India was the BS6 Phase 2 transition, as well\\nas within PV, the Altroz, iCNG, “Oh my God, CNG” was the campaign, which I'm sure a lot of you have\\nseen, doing very well for us. Otherwise, from a JLR perspective, the order book of 185K as well as the\\nlaunch of the Agratas, Tata Son's arm that is investing in battery cells, launching and announcing its\\nmanufacturing facility to supply, i.e. to manufacture in the UK. That was a big announcement last week.\\nNext Slide, please.\\nAt the outset, a very strong set of numbers coming through, and actually quite happy with the sequential\\nmomentum that is building in the business. And, therefore, again, one more quarter where all three\\nautomotive verticals were delivering profitable numbers. So, happy with the set of numbers coming\\nthrough. Revenue at 42% growth, PBT bei at ~Rs. 5,300 crores, a swing of almost ~Rs. 10,000 crores over\\nlast year, same time. Seasonally, a weak quarter, despite that PBT (bei) being better than the Q4 last year.\\nEBITDA of 14.4% up 700 bps, EBIT of 8.1% up 880 bps. And for the first time in my memory, which we can\\nwe went back into the results, I don't think we recollect a quarter where we delivered positive free cash\\nflows in the first quarter. So all in all, very happy with the set of numbers that have come through. Next\\nSlide, please.\\nWhere did this growth come from? 30% of the 42% growth came from volume and mix and 8% from price.\\nAnd, of course, profitability came through from both JLR and commercial vehicles in a strong manner. JLR\\nactually, a standout performance in this quarter and CV continuing to pick up momentum. PV had a steady\\nquarter and I'm sure Shailesh is going to talk about that as well. And again, net debt continuing to reduce\\nfurther in this quarter as well and on track as far as whatever plans that we have laid out. So with this, let\\nme hand it over to Richard. Richard, are you there? Hello? Richard, can you hear us?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nRichard Molyneux\\nHang on, can you hear me now?\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYes, I can. Go ahead, Richard.\\nRichard Molyneux\\nPerfect, okay. Well, look, I'd actually like to hold on this chart. Where's it gone? Where's the chart gone?\\nP. B. Balaji\\nOne minute, one minute.\\nRichard Molyneux\\nThere it is. I'd actually like to hold on this chart for a couple of seconds, partly because it's a stunning\\npicture, but also because it's a perfect reflection, an exemplar of our modern luxury strategy at JLR. It's\\nthe Range Rover Sport SV, Edition One. Over 2,000 of them, at a price of between GBP160,000 and\\nGBP190,000, and they're all reserved before we've even started production. That's what JLR can do.\\nSo, if we move on to the next chart, this is the number set that we've been able to present, so revenue\\nGBP 6.9 billion, down slightly as our volume was 1% below, and we also had some impact of foreign\\nexchange coming through. But PBT, all positive, EBIT, 8.6%, that is the highest EBIT that we have achieved\\nin six years, and EBITDA, 16.3%, that is the highest EBITDA that we have achieved in eight years. I will say\\nthat there's one sort of one-off item within that 8.6% EBIT, so the underlying is more like 7.5%, but that\\nunderlying item to do with the manufacturing absorption is non-cash item. So our free cash flow in the\\nquarter, GBP 451 million, an improvement of c. GBP1.2 billion over the same quarter last year. Okay. So,\\nif we move forward.\\nSo, this is a summary of what I've said. The only additional points to note on here is our order book remains\\nstrong, 185,000 units, 76% of which are still Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender. And our net\\ndebt is now down to just below GBP 2.5 billion from GBP 3 billion at the end of last quarter. So, a very\\npositive move, leaves us with GBP 4.0 billion of cash, and an undrawn RCF of GBP1.5 billion. The next\\nchart, please.\\nOkay. In terms of volumes, this shows wholesales at the top and retails at the bottom. The story is fairly\\nsimilar in both counts. So, wholesales is 1% lower than the previous quarter, retails virtually exactly the\\nsame, and that is the second consecutive quarter that we've had over 100,000 retails through our\\nnetwork. Within the brands, Range Rover is slightly down. The biggest impact in that is Velar, where we're\\nmoving to a facelifted mid-cycle refresh of that car in '24 model year. So, we're in the middle of the\\ntransition between the old Velar and the new Velar. That's the biggest impact there. But I will call out\\nDefender. Defender is now consistently running at a rate of over 100,000 vehicles per year. And it is\\nwinning awards. It won the Autovista Award in the UK for the residual value, highest residual values\\namong large SUVs. And residual values are an extremely good indicator of brand strength. So, we've grown\\nthis brand to a run rate of c.100,000 units with an extremely high RV over the past three or four years.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nAnd that does give us some confidence that when we come to do the same thing with Jaguar and\\nreimagine that brand, that we will be able to generate some success. Discovery and Jaguar at the moment\\nin their current incarnations are relatively flat. Okay, next chart please.\\nThis looks at the same number set but splits it by region rather than by brand. And if I start with China,\\nChina you can see is reasonably flat quarter-on-quarter. And the JV within China is making money. It had\\nPBT of GBP19 million in the quarter. EBITDA of 15% and EBIT of 4%. So, whilst we understand there are\\nlots of pressures in China, we're still showing a good performance. Overseas for us remains extremely\\nstrong and North America also. We do have some small challenges in within the UK and Europe. The UK\\nhas a specific issue in relation to moving from Q4 to Q1, because in Q4 there is the March registration\\nplate in the UK, which always provides a boost in sales. So, there's always a seasonality between Q4 and\\nQ1 within the UK. But there is an underlying issue that we're dealing with in both the UK and Europe,\\nwhich is, we still have some supply shortages. They're not generic in the same way that they were\\nbeforehand, but we still have some constraints within our PHEV supply system, and the PHEV, particularly\\non the Range Rover where there is a pure electric range of over 100 kilometers, is in extremely high\\ndemand and we're still working with our supply base to bring supply up to the level of that demand. So,\\nthat's the reason why there's slightly more muted performance in the UK and Europe outside of even the\\nseasonality effect within the UK. That is also the reason on the right-hand side where if you look at our\\npowertrain mix, the percentage which is BEV and PHEV down in the bottom right is actually lower than it\\nwas last quarter. And that is all to do with the supply constraints that we have in terms of PHEV availability.\\nSo, we then move to the next chart.\\nSo, this shows the walk of PBT from the same quarter last year where we made a loss of GBP524 million\\nto this quarter where we’re showing GBP435 million favourable. And profit after tax, by the way, is\\nGBP323 million. So, that walk is largely volume and mix. But if you look at the split within that, there’s\\nactually more of it which is mix. And this is our continued drive to ensure that we’re selling strong,\\nprofitable vehicles. So for example, on an annual basis, Range Rover itself moved from 8% of our mix to\\n18%, and Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender moved from 45% to 63%. Even within the P&A\\nbusiness, we’re showing considerable strength, partly that is due to the fact that the same quarter last\\nyear involved a shutdown in China, but also the recovery of our volume in recent quarters has created an\\nincrease in the size of the car park, the young car park in particular, and it’s that young car park which we\\npenetrate more in terms of P&A sales. So a strong performance from our P&A business generating in total\\nGBP829 million worth of volume and mix. Pricing for us also remains positive. If you look in totality, it has\\na benefit of GBP197 million versus GBP78 million adverse on cost. So GBP120 million favorable. And even\\nif you look at that over a two-year horizon until the back into the times before inflation took hold, the net\\nof those two would be positive to the tune of around GBP80 million. But we need that, because one\\nrepresentation is that we also have inflation within our structural cost base, both in terms of labor and\\nthe utilities, and even the interest that we pay in our debt, which is slightly related to inflation. So we\\nneed to keep that contribution revenue minus contribution cost positive to make sure that at a total\\ncompany level we’re even, and we believe we are.\\nSo, within structural costs, we are starting to invest more in terms of FMI, that is fixed marketing, and that\\nis a long lead effect in terms of lead generation and demand generation at the back end of this year. This\\nstuff is never instant in terms of its impact. So we're starting to invest now to ensure that we have the\\ndemand in the back end of this year and going into next year. Admin is largely our transformation, so the\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nbiggest impact there is in terms of our digital cost, our digital transformation, and engineering I'll talk\\nabout in a minute. FX did exactly what you would expect in the quarter. This is a quarter of strengthening\\nsterling, about three points on the dollar. That leads to an operational FX adverse for us, and we\\noperationally prefer a weaker sterling being a UK exporter. But we were c. 60% to 70% hedged on that\\nexposure, and therefore we have a hedge pickup that you can see there. Revaluation was positive,\\ncertainly on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but that's largely because the previous quarter Q1, FY23, saw a\\nreally big move in sterling and actually in that quarter there was a negative reval of GBP 112 million which\\nis essentially reversing this time around. So, that is what generates our GBP435 million worth of profit\\nbefore tax, as I mentioned before that turns into GBP323 million after tax. Next chart.\\nThis shows the walk from PBT to cash. When you take the PBT net out D&A and other non-cash items and\\ntake off cash tax, you get to a cash profit after tax of GBP 1,135 million. That is the highest that we can\\nsee on record as well. And what that does, even with GBP 700 million worth of investment, is it generates\\na GBP450 million free cash flow. And that GBP 450 million of free cash flow is without any working capital\\nimpact. So, this is strong underlying cash flow not driven by working capital movements. Next page.\\nSo, the next page does talk about investment. So in total, GBP 697 million, which GBP 174 million is capital.\\nThe rest is engineering. Our engineering capitalization rate is 61% in the quarter, up from 53% in the\\nprevious quarter. This is natural. This is part of our cycle plan. Between 2024 and 2026, we have EMA, we\\nhave new Jaguar, and we have MLA BEV coming, and the engineers are working hard on those programs.\\nAnd those programs are the ones which are already past their capitalization gates. So, this is a natural part\\nof our cycle that will probably stay at these levels for a few months. But overall, if you look at a very\\nsmooth position, we would expect 50% to 60% capitalization. One point I do want to make is that our\\nfixed asset base this quarter is flat, within GBP 7 million quid on a basis of GBP11 billion. So D&A is virtually\\nexactly the same as the amount capitalized. We are not driving earnings by building up the balance sheet.\\nNext page.\\nSo if we move into a business update, so on the left hand side here you can see our wholesale volume. It\\nis marginally down but on an absolute trend increase. We still do have chip and other supply constraints.\\nI've mentioned PHEV beforehand. We do expect them to slowly reduce over time but we're still in the\\nphase where our production systems are flowing but they're not flowing as fluently or automatically as\\nwe'd like. It still requires very active management on our side to make sure that we're looking through\\nour supply base to identify problems. And we're working, for example, in the world of AI and digital science\\nwith a company called Everstream to try and look through our supply base much more cleanly through to\\nTier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier N to be able to get insight of any problems that are coming. So it is working,\\nbut it's not a perfectly functioning machine as of yet, still requires active management. For Q2, we expect\\nour production to be lower than Q1, and that's a natural effect of we have two weeks of shutdown coming\\nin the first half of August. So we will have production and cash flow lower than in Q1, but we would expect\\nwholesales and profitability much more in-line with recent quarters. Next page.\\nThis is absolutely crucial for us. This is the rate of production of Range Rover and Range Rover Sport in\\nSolihull. Been progressively growing, 2,300 per week in Q3, 2,600 and 2,800. That will stay constant for a\\nlittle bit of time, but we have a second body shop being installed as we speak in Solihull, which will increase\\nour capacity by a further 30% in future quarters. So we will be able to take Range Rover, Range Rover\\nSport production over the 3,000 units per week barrier. That's really important for us, as we try and build\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

But in fact, it's too\\nhigh, because customers are waiting too long for their cars at the moment. Next chart.\\nWe're continuing to invest in our product. So there's two examples here of what we've been up to this\\nquarter. There's '24 model year Range Rover Evoque on the left-hand side with a much tighter, neater\\nexterior package, and new technology. So the PHEV on this car now goes 35 miles, sorry, 39 miles on a\\npure electric charge. But it's not just exteriors. Interior‘s on the right-hand side. This is Discovery Sport. A\\nmassive change on the interior of the car, very much in-line with our modern luxury vision, and the way\\nthat we want to take the Discovery brand in terms of its focus on family, on stowage, on seating, and on\\nwellness. Next chart.\\nIt goes without saying, that the announcement last week was an honor for us to have the Chairman and\\nRishi here in Gaydon, and it's an honor for us to have a parent that is prepared to put such money into a\\nfactory in the UK to support JLR, which is a UK business. It was a fantastic day for Tata and a fantastic day\\nfor JLR. It is also absolutely symptomatic of the scope synergies that we can obtain by being part of the\\nTata ecosystem. Yet we may not have the type of vertical automotive synergies that you get within a VW\\nworld, but the scope of the businesses within the Tata empire allow us to access synergies, that no\\nvertically integrated OEM would be able to generate, and this is one absolutely perfect example of that.\\nNext chart.\\nSo, outlook for the rest of this year. We do remain optimistic, but we do have to actively manage our\\nindustrial operation and supply base to make sure we continue production at the rates that we've got at\\nthe moment. Inflation is starting to moderate, and that's good news for our business and good news for\\nthe economy worldwide. But we do expect Q2, from our own financial forecast perspective, to be a little\\nbit worse in terms of production and cash flow, although wholesales and profitability will be more in-line\\nwith recent quarters, and we will revisit our guidance after Q2. So, if all goes as we expect, we might look\\nat revising our P&L guidance upwards at that time. So our priorities, you can read there, continue to work\\non supply availability, focus on continuing to drive our brands, vehicles such that, that you saw at the start\\non that chart, the Range Rover Sport SV, drive activation, drive orders, and execute our reimagined plans\\nflawlessly.

And EBITDA was higher by 390 bps close to the doubledigit that we have been signaling which in a seasonally low quarter is a good starting point for the year\\nand of course EBIT up 370 bps but losing operating leverage because of the marginal growth in revenue\\nthat you saw. Next Slide, please.\\nWhere did the monies come from? Fundamentally on volumes as well as on realization. This is what, it\\njust tells you that we are on strategy, and that's more or less explains the entire lot. Next slide, please.\\nLet me hand it over to Girish to take you through the business highlights. Girish?\\nGirish Wagh\\nYeah. Thanks, Balaji. So, I think the wholesale volume was kind of flat or actually reduced by around 2%.\\nBut, if we see the registration volumes, I think they actually declined by around 6%, which is a true\\nindication. For us, I think there was a good growth in both EBITDA and EBIT margins by 380 and 350 bps\\nover Q1 FY23, and essentially this happened on the back of both realization improvement, as well as cost\\nreduction, which was also used to negate some of the increases when we migrated from BS6 Phase 1 to\\nPhase 2. As Balaji mentioned, I think our share impacted in Q1 more due to constrained availability.\\nBecause when we migrated to BS6 Phase 2, I think almost entire range we have changed completely. We\\nhave upgraded the entire range for power-to-weight ratios. We have upgraded the range for value\\nenhancers, whether it is in connectivity, comfort and convenience, total cost of operation. So, I think as a\\nresult of this, we had a high amount of change content. That led to a challenge on availability in terms of\\nproductionization, as well as ramp-up. But as we ended the quarter, we are out of it and we are back to\\nthe required level of production now.\\nIn terms of non-vehicle business, I think the revenue grew by around 25%, over the same quarter in\\nprevious year. So, we continue to grow at a very high rate. Now this is the third year when we are growing\\nat a very brisk pace. We continue to improve both our spares and service penetration in our own network\\nas well as the retail net. On the CNG price correction, with the implementation of Kirit Parikh Committee,\\nwe have seen some improvement in the retail salience in small commercial vehicles. Nut we believe that\\nas the message goes into the market and customers understand that there's going to be more\\ndependability on the rates and the differential between diesel and CNG, I think gradually, CNG should pick\\nup. In terms of bright spots, I would say first of all, the sentiment index that we measure every quarter\\nhas inched up for the trucks and tippers both. So, M&HCV sentiment index has gone up. The small\\ncommercial vehicles has also gone up marginally after a few quarters of decline. But the intermediate and\\nlight commercial vehicles still remains lower. In the quarter gone by, I think, we had a good growth in\\nM&HCV’s by around 3%. And in the passenger carriers, good growth of 11.5% despite availability\\nconstraints. So, I think, the passenger market now is back to the pre-COVID levels.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nIn terms of digital, the contribution of digital lead generation and then conversion continue to increase\\nover FY23. And we have now around 16% of our sales being generated from digitally driven channels. As\\nI said, entire product range migrated into BS6 Phase 2 with a lot of improvements in total cost of\\nownership, performance, connectivity, comfort and convenience. And this, we believe, will be a major\\nadvantage for us going ahead. We also followed it up with, first of its kind, an influencer testimonials and\\nadvocacy event, wherein we had more than 250 influencers testing our vehicles and giving their positive\\ntestimonials. We have also started field trials of the BS6 Phase 2 vehicles, which is also indicating a very\\ngood performance improvement over this BS6 Phase 1, and therefore good customer acceptance. Going\\nahead, I think with improved availability in Q2, we will continue our focus on realization improvement and\\nretail growth, which should drive our Vahan share recovery. And towards this, we will have to drive the\\nBS6 Phase 2, both product and brand superiority in the micro segments and markets. We will scale up the\\nEV supplies now, both on the ACE electric vehicle and the electric buses. I think, we have now the FAME\\ncertificates available for all the variants. We continue to grow in the downstream with consistent growth\\nin the spares and service penetration. On international markets, I think, the volumes still remain subdued.\\nOur focus is on maintaining market shares, improving margins. And in fact, we have improved margins in\\nthe international business compared with Q1 of last year and also the entire last year. And we are also\\nimproving the channel health, as the markets continue to operate at lower volumes. Anish, next slide.\\nOn the new businesses, on electric mobility, as a part of the CESL first tender, we have now deployed\\nmore than 100 buses, so almost 180 buses that we have deployed in Q1 of FY24. And we have now more\\nthan 600 buses which are operational. The new buses that we have deployed, within three weeks, they\\nhave covered almost 5 lakh kilometers and total our electric buses have now covered more than 75 million\\nkilometers. Even in the new buses deployed, we are able to get an availability of more than 95% in the\\nnew depots. Overall, we sold 600 electric vehicles in the quarter that's including ACE and the buses. And\\nI think we have been focusing on developing the ecosystem, especially for ACE, we have now more than\\n31 EV support centers set up across the country. So we are increasing the number of cities where we will\\nmake ACE-EV available. We've ramped up the production capacity. And as I mentioned, we now have the\\nFAME certificate for most of the applications with which we will start ramping up the retail. In addition to\\nthis, after we signed the agreement with Cummins for formation of a JV, actually the new wholly owned\\nsubsidiary was set up to develop and manufacture a range of low and zero emission powertrains as a\\ncontinuation of agreement that we had signed with Cummins.\\nComing to the smart city mobility, the DTC CESL operations, as I said, started from 29th June. More than\\n200 buses have been deployed. And as I said, we have more than 95% availability consistently over the\\npast few weeks. And the e-bus fleet, the earlier one as well as the new one, has crossed more than 75\\nmillion kilometers and the operational revenue in the first quarter was around Rs. 133 crores.\\nMoving on to the digital businesses, Fleet Edge now has almost 450,000 vehicles on the platform. We also\\nintroduced the subscription models, which was very well received by the customers. We had two options,\\na basic as well as an advanced one. And equal interest being shown in both the subscription models. We\\nhave been consistently improving the engagement time with the increased insights that are being\\nprovided. And apart from the insights, there are also a lot of nudges for performance improvement, which\\nthe fleet owners are finding very useful. E-Dukaan, our online marketplace, it grew by 250% over Q1 of\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nFY23. So, as we increase the number of customers and retailers coming onto this platform, I think, this\\nwill continue to grow at a very high rate as we go ahead.\\nSo that's the summary of the CV business. Back to you, Balaji.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThanks, Girish. Next Slide, please. Moving on to PV. Overall numbers, draw your attention to the domestic\\nmarket share of 14.2%, very happy with us consolidating our position in the face of significant competitive\\nonslaught on multiple fronts. So, happy to see this number starting to improve from here on. And of\\ncourse, other number to call out is the EV penetration, which is now at 14% of the portfolio, and CNG at\\n8% of the portfolio, both auger well for the future. Next slide, please.\\nOn the EV side, we ended the quarter at 19,000 units, on track now for 100,000 kind of volume for the\\nfull-year basis. The new launch is also lined up. And the Vahan market share is maintained at 76% despite\\nsignificant competitive intervention that happened during the quarter. And of course, the infrastructure\\nhas continued to strengthen, and we'll continue to build on those. Next slide, please.\\nOn the financials, volumes grew 7.7%, revenue at 11%, and PBT bei of about Rs. 200 crores is what we\\nended the quarter at, with an EBITDA declining by 80 bps, 6.1% to 5.3%. I'll talk about it in a minute. And\\nEBIT - because of operating leverage increasing by 10 bps.\\nAnd draw your attention to the PV EV financial split, that is there. If you notice the PV business, we\\ncontinuing to build EBITDA performance on a full-year basis where 8.5% and this quarter was 8.6%. On\\nthe EV side, the EBITDA margin did go down, but a lot of it is also coming from two aspects. One is we had\\nIPL in the early part of the year where we had Tiago EV on full blast in IPL, which has given us substantial\\norder intake, and that will not be there in the second half of the year. And the second is lithium prices\\n\\nwere on the higher side for the last nine months, and we are seeing the reduction starting to\\ncome through from the current quarter onwards. And, then on top of it, if I add PLI, which we\\nhave now filed for Tiago EVs, the ARAI certificates have been received, and now we're going to\\nthe next phase of filing to the ministry. Quite confident that the second half of the year, you\\nshould see the EV business also coming to add to those numbers. So, overall, you should take as far as EBITDA is for EV is concerned, the only losses you should be seeing, if at all, is related to\\nproduct investments that we are making and nothing else that should be there. So, quite\\ncomfortable with the way this mix is. So, the other way the overall EBITDA is just a mix issue that\\nis playing out, but the individual portions have their own plans and own strategies. Next Slide,\\nplease.\\nLet me, the same number playing out, if you look at the volume, mix realization, variable cost, all trending\\nin the right direction. The investment that we are making in terms of additional employees coming on\\nboard, more FME being put into the EV business for IPL, those are the stuff that are playing out in the\\nnumbers that you see.\\nNext Slide. Let me give it to Shailesh to take you through the business.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nThank you, Balaji. So let me start with the industry. Quarter one, FY 24 was strong from a wholesales\\ngrowth perspective, 9% growth versus the same quarter last financial year. EV wholesale has seen a very\\nstrong growth, 2.5x to what it was in the last financial year. And it has touched nearly 27,000 for the first\\ntime. And this is on the back of several new launches which have happened in the industry, including Tiago\\nEV for Tata Motors. SUV segment has seen multiple launches by various players, and consequently the\\nsalience has further increased by 6%, now touching nearly 47%. Of course, this has come at the cost of\\nhatches and sedan also, to some extent, going down. You can see now hatch segment has come down to\\n32%. So that's what's been happening in the industry.\\nComing to Tata Motors, PV and EV, we continue to be a very strong number three player. And as Balaji\\nmentioned, that we have further increased our market share to 14.2% despite several competitive launch\\nactivities that we have been seeing specifically in the SUV space. We have maintained our number one\\nposition in the compact SUV segment, which is combination of Nexon and Punch. And number two in the\\nnumber two in the high SUV segment, which is Harrier and Safari. After more than a decade, I would say,\\nwe attained number two position in hatches. And this is coming out of the way the multi-power train\\nstrategy has unfolded for us, Tiago EV and Altroz CNG with the twin-cylinder technology that we launched\\nhas been really taken well in the market, and both these products are doing really good. And that has\\nreally led us to increase our volumes, market share in hatches, and of course the rank. As far as EVs are\\nconcerned, in-line with the industry, we also more than doubled our volumes as compared to where we\\nwere in the same quarter last financial year, touching 19,000 plus. So, that has been broadly the highlights\\nof the industry and passenger vehicle and EV business.\\nGoing forward the bright spots that we see that there is a strong booking pipeline in the industry. The\\ndemand is held at a very high level. EV adoption is now growing beyond the top 20 cities, I think, the bias\\nis now moving to other parts of the country, and that's a good sign in terms of how the EV sales will grow\\nfrom here. Demand in South and West should step-up with the beginning of the festive season in the\\nsecond half of this quarter. So, these are the bright spots that we see in this quarter, quarter two. As far\\nas Tata Motors is concerned, Altroz iCNG, which we launched in May, has been very well received and we\\nhave a very strong booking pipeline. Tiago EV, also supported by IPL and the awareness that it created for\\nthis product, has also been seeing very strong bookings. We have also launches planned in the coming\\nmonths, adding additional trim because we have been really watching in every segment which are the\\nprice points where the velocity of demand is more, and therefore we have been coming with creative\\ntrims to really help us grow our volumes and a few of them are going to come in this quarter also.\\nAs far as challenges are concerned, we know that already last financial year was a high base, and therefore\\nthat impact is going to come in terms of growth rates. We also know that last year the festive season was\\nin September, October, which is now going to be October and November. So, therefore, there will be\\ndemand which will be more stronger in quarter three as compared to quarter two. Therefore, the channel\\ninventory is likely to grow slightly ahead of the festive season. Our share of hatch and sedan may come\\nunder further pressure with the new launches that have happened recently in the industry. As far as we\\nare concerned, we'll focus on retail momentum in quarter two. A lot of marketing actions that we have\\nplanned for, as far as our growth is concerned in hatches, Tiago and Altroz will be the key focus. And as\\nthat with EV and CNG, both these products are really doing good and I've seen significant growth. While\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nin contrary, we are seeing in the industry the hatches are under pressure, but we have been growing and\\nenhancing our market share. We are committed to overcome the margin gap that we have versus the\\nbenchmark and we are driving a very institutionalized cost reduction program in the company for the last\\ntwo- three years. And every year we have been getting significant cost reduction. This is something which\\nwe will drive. EVs, we have several tailwinds from a margin improvement perspective. Some of them Balaji\\nmentioned, but there's also a lot of new generation aggregates at a lesser cost also that is going to kickin for us and a lot of localization activities, which is also going to add to some of the other tailwinds that\\nwas mentioned earlier.\\nSo that's the update from my side, back to you Balaji.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYeah. Thanks Shailesh. So overall CV plus PV, the quarter saw a cash outflow of almost Rs. 2,000 crores,\\nalmost entirely explained by working capital. And this is seasonal, particularly driven from CV. It's reversing\\ngoing forward. Next Slide.\\nOn the Capex side, we are guided for Rs. 8,000 crores, and we are on track for that. Next Slide.\\nTata Motors Finance. Let me take a few minutes on this one. We are back to profitability at INR22 crores,\\nnot good enough, but it's a start. AUM of ~ Rs. 42,000 crores. And absolute GNPA is now reducing on a\\nquarter-on-quarter basis, it went down further by Rs. 191 crores. And on a year-on-year basis, it's down\\nby almost Rs. 539 crores. And therefore, the focus on portfolio quality and pricing discipline on new\\ndisbursals is definitely yielding results. And we will continue to be focused on this one. And the business\\nis on track to deliver the double-digit ROE in the medium term that we had called out. And its focus will\\nbe on NIM’s, which are already improving, lowering credit losses, which is on track, and tight controls on\\ncosts that continues.\\nIn the meanwhile, the demerger of the NBFC business of Tata Motors Finance into Tata Motors Finance\\nSolution has been completed. And therefore, all lending activities have now been consolidated into one\\nentity. And one NBFC license will be surrendered in the coming days. Next Slide.\\nCredit ratings continue to improve. You've seen all the information on this, and we hope to continue this\\ntrend in the coming days and would be engaging with the agencies proactively. Next Slide.\\nOverall, looking ahead, I think we remain optimistic on the demand, despite near-term uncertainties. And\\ninflation, we do expect to be moderate. And this momentum will build through the year as we factor in\\nseasonality, improved supplies, RDE impact, and the new PV launches, no change from what we called out\\nlast time. And therefore, we do aim to sustain on this performance and deliver a strong performance on\\na full-year basis. So, the priorities for the respective businesses are clear, and we intend to execute them\\nflawlessly. And this quarter is one of just executing what we said we will do. And it's our intention to keep\\nrepeating that in the coming quarters as well.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nQuestions and Answers session\\nSo, with this, let me open up questions, which is a fair number of them that have already come up. And\\nlet me start. I think there's lots of questions coming to your way Richard and Adrian. So, let me start.\\nFirst is the question related to depreciation expense on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Any reason why that's\\ncoming down? And second is, how are the demand trends that are there for the various segments? And,\\ncan you just talk about that?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nOkay. So, yes, depreciation down by GBP 30 million to GBP 40 million quarter-over-quarter. That's the\\nnatural effect of the wind-out of the impairment that we took a couple of years ago. It's entirely natural.\\nAdrian Mardell\\nAnd the demand, yeah look, demand's actually been steady proportionally overall, the overall the base is\\nfalling as we said it would. It's consistent in Q1 with the fall in Q4, so no change there. The order bank is\\nstill 76% of the big three, which is exactly the same as last quarter as well. So we're pretty much seeing\\nthe ongoing trend, we called out six months ago, and we'll continue over the next six months for sure.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThanks Adrain, I think question, Shailesh your way. Reason for sharp decline in EV segment profitability. I\\nthought we had covered in my section, but you further want to add light on that?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah, Balaji, I think you pretty much covered. I think the major increase came from the cell prices in the\\nsecond half of last financial year, continuing till the last quarter. And this was nearly a 35% jump that we\\nhad seen, but it is now moderating. And the good news is that, in the H2, this is going to release significant\\nmargin benefit. It has already seen a sharp recovery to the numbers that we were seeing in the H1 of\\nFY23. The second reason, Balaji, again mentioned, roughly a 200 bps impact that we got because of the\\nfront-loading of fixed marketing expenses due to IPL. And, yes, we also are seeing costs coming from\\nSanand 2, which is the Ford plant that we had acquired in TPEM. All these are for the right reasons, right?\\nAnd the tailwinds on the external factors which were impacting the profitability is going to now kind of\\nhelp us in going forward. So, these have been the reasons, but not of concern, because tailwinds are in\\nfavor of EV segment, and there are a lot of cost reductions also on top of that, that we have been working\\non through localization and also going into the generation two aggregates, which are at lesser costs.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThanks, Shailesh. I think Girish next set of questions coming here, there are a series of questions on two\\nthemes. One is demand and how do you see demand coming through and number two is you are losing\\nmarket shares as Tata Motors. What are we going to do with respect to restoring market shares? And are\\nwe having a rethink or how do you want to think about profitability versus market shares? We spend some\\ntime on these two?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nGirish Wagh\\nOkay. So, I think first of all on the demand environment, if I were to limit myself to the second quarter.\\nSo, we do expect the second quarter demand to be more than that of the Q2 of last year. And depending\\nupon the segment, I think it will vary between 5% to 10%. The ILMCV segment will grow the least. And the\\npassenger segment will grow the maximum, is what it appears right now. We are also expecting the HCV\\nsegment, the heavy commercial vehicle segment to grow in double-digits. So, that is what we are looking\\nat currently. I think there is also a subset question here, Balaji, about July. So, July is traditionally a low\\nmonth because the rains have started every year. And specifically this year, I think some of the states have\\nseen a higher amount of rain. That would be seen in the demand, but I think as the rains subside, we will\\nsee a good pickup in demand.\\nNow, as far as market share versus profitability, I think as we have communicated earlier also, we are\\ngoing to grow profitably. That is the target that we have set for ourselves. And, how will we get our market\\nshare back is by delivering value through superior products. So, I think we are focusing squarely on\\ndelivering higher value to the customers.\\nAs I mentioned in my talk earlier in the presentation, I think, we have upgraded the entire range bumperto-bumper, from the smallest vehicle to biggest vehicle. So, a lot of improvements done in the total cost\\nof ownership, we've improved a lot of value enhancers in the product, which will therefore deliver value\\nto the customer. So, we will squarely focus on delivering better value to the customer, and followed by\\nthen communicating this value. For communicating this value, we are focusing on a lot of ATL, as well as\\nbrand building activities, followed by very unique, as I said, influencer advocacy, where we had a huge\\nnumber of influencers who actually drove the vehicle and gave very positive reviews about the vehicles.\\nThis will be followed by a lot of BTL activation to communicate this to individual customers and a lot of\\nback-to-back trials to prove the benefits. And, also we have started leveraging our Fleet Edge to actually\\nimprove the delivered benefit on ground, right? So Fleet Edge insights is helping customers to actually\\nachieve better fluid economy or fuel efficiency. And this coupled with our Sampoorna Seva Service\\npackage, I mean, we will deliver a peace of mind to the customer. And with this, we will focus on profitable\\ngrowth. So, I think, our fundamental approach is to deliver more value to the customer. And once that\\nvalue is experienced by the customer, then go on increasing the realization. The way we have done right\\nfrom the beginning of Q3 of the last year, Balaji.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThanks, Girish. Richard, this is coming your way. Let me summarize a few themes that are coming out.\\nOne is, Q2 in particular, this quarter, we delivered 93,000. How are volumes likely to be there, and is it\\nthen strong enough to deliver the 400,000 plus that you had guided in the year? That's one set of\\nquestions.\\nSecond, I think linked to margins, which you have touched about briefly but there is a lot of curiosity\\naround it, saying that first of all, it is 8.6% for the quarter, but you said there's some one-offs there. What\\nare these one-offs? You're saying underlying 7.5%. How does that math work out? Number one, two, and\\nnumber three. This is the kind of number. How do you then look at 6% EBIT margins? Are you going to up\\nyour margins thereafter? Can you talk about these three?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nRichard Molyneux\\nYes, absolutely. So, the first issue, are we comfortable on 400,000 for the full year? Yes, we are. So, we\\nhave said that Q2 will be similar to previous quarters, and that was 95,000 units in Q4 last year and 93,000\\nunits this quarter. But we've already built up from our production actuals last quarter of 103,000 units.\\nWe're already putting some inventory in the system to allow us to sell higher volume in the back end of\\nthe year. And I also mentioned that we have a second body shop coming on stream for our MLA Range\\nRover and Range Rover Sport that will impact us in the back end of the year. So, yes, we are still in line\\nwith 400,000 units commitment for the full year.\\nIn terms of the second question, in terms of the one-offs, the effect of building 10,000 units more than\\nyour wholesale, is that a proportion of our manufacturing costs gets absorbed onto the balance sheet.\\nThat during the quarter was GBP60 million. That's by far the biggest of the one-offs. And that's what drives\\nthe reported EBIT of 8.6% down to what I've specified as an underlying of around 7.5%.\\nAnd then in terms of the guidance, what we've said is we'll review it in three months time. And if we, if\\nthe world progresses as we expect it to, then we'll review it. And certainly on the P&L, the EBIT side of\\nthings, it wouldn't be impossible that we would revise it upwards at that time.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThanks Richard. Adrian, this is probably for you, both in terms of demand again. China growth\\nexpectations is improving as per industry experts. How's the order book in China? How's it looking? And\\nelsewhere, I saw another question. Can you just talk about the demand situation in your various markets\\nto give us a sense of how is it playing out?\\nAdrian Mardell\\nSo, China, we'll sell more units in China this fiscal year than last fiscal year. Again, our big three products,\\nRange Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender are selling very well into China, and we expect they will\\ncontinue to do so through the balance of the quarters, certainly through calendar year 2023. Order banks\\ndon't build in China quite like they would do in UK and Europe. By the way, the customers do like stock on\\nthe ground, so to some extent we actually see the ongoing order bank in China be fed by more product\\nactually being put into the marketplace, and Richard mentioned, that we are putting more product onto\\nthe water to enable that in the second half of the year.\\nThe actual order bank number for China, the team have just shown me, is just over 10,000 units, but order\\nbanks in China don't get built in other way, other regions will be 40,000 or 50,000, just the way they are.\\nCan you repeat your second half of the question Balaji? I missed that, I'm sorry.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThe rest of your demand in various parts of the world, how are you seeing it develop?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nAdrian Mardell\\nI see. Okay, thank you, yeah. So we do see demand increase in the second half of the year, effectively, as\\nwe supply more units. We will increase retails with more fulfillment. We're particularly strong at the\\nmoment around those three products. And the biggest regions that really are pulling demand for those\\nthree products are North America, Middle East, and reference back to the China comment as well.\\nSo, particularly strong on our big three products in those three regions. And from what we can see, that\\nwill continue for the balance of this year. And by the way, we should also say our variable marketing\\nstimulation on those products are very, very low, less than 1% in all of those three places. And their fixed\\nmarketing for those products in those regions also are very, very low. So, should we get to the point at\\nthe end of the year that it starts to turn off, we particularly on fixed marketing, which would always be\\nour preference. We have the ability to stimulate more orders by marketing means.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nGot it. Let me flip it to Girish, on costs. On RM costs, what kind of reduction do you expect in Q2\\nconsidering the recent drop in precious metals and base metals? How do you see the inflation there? And\\nsecond one, Shailesh, coming at your end, PLI, how do you intend to treat those benefits?\\nGirish Wagh\\nSo on the first one, I think what has a bigger impact in commercial vehicles is the steel, both flat and long.\\nAnd I think it appears that the prices more or less will go back to the level of Q4 of last year. So, from Q4\\nto Q1, we had an increase in the steel prices. And as we get from Q1 to Q2, the prices will go back to Q4\\nlevels. So, you can imagine the kind of benefit that would be there. In addition to this, we are also seeing\\nreduction in the prices of batteries for electric vehicles that’s an additional advantage that we will be\\nseeing.\\nShailesh, over to you.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah, regarding PLI, I think we are the first four-wheeler manufacturer to have filed the application with\\nthe certification agency, and in the coming months, we believe that as per the new SOP that has been\\nreleased by MHI, we should be able to get the benefit. So, hoping that in the second half of the year, we\\nshould start realizing the benefit. Regarding how we are going to treat this in terms of pricing action, I\\nthink, you would have realized that a part of it is already factored in our strategic pricing in some of our\\nmodels. And going forward, depending on how the overall competitive landscape pans out, we'll take\\ncalls.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYeah, thanks, Shailesh. On the same inflation point, Richard, coming your way, how are you seeing the\\ndecline in raw materials as we get into the second half of the year?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nRichard Molyneux\\nLook, we are seeing likewise some favorable, particularly in Aluminum and some other metals. This takes\\na while to feed through, obviously, we're significantly hedged on many of those materials. But we do\\nexpect it to net of hedging to flow through into the second half of the year. We sort of expect the dynamic\\nin the second half of the year to be slightly lower material costs, but very slightly increasing VME as well.\\nSo sort of offsetting within margins.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThank you. I think there's one question on the battery plant. Maybe I will take that. The Capex for next\\nyear in JLR, does it include the new battery plant investment made by Tata. Just to clarify, both JLR and\\nTata Motors are not investees in this company. It's a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Tata's Sons.\\nAgratas is 100% owned by Tata's Sons. So we are both anchor customers here as both Tata Motors and\\nJLR are. For the India plant, Tata Motors will be the anchor customer. For the UK plant, JLR is an anchor\\ncustomer. So there's no cash outflow / investment being made by these companies into Agratas.\\nSo one thing on R&D capitalization, Richard, at your end went to 61%, a bit of flavor around it, and what\\ndo you see to be a stable number?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nYeah, so look, our capitalization varies across our cycle. A few quarters ago, it was as low as 28% and 53%\\nand now 61%. And it's because we have a fairly concentrated product cadence in 2024 to 2026, so a lot of\\nour engineers are now working on programs at quite a late stage in their development cycle, and it's those\\nprograms at the late stage of cycle that tend to get capitalized. So it's something that varies through our\\ncycle. We believe that sort of a long-term average, given where we are, it is more in the 50% to 60% range,\\nand we would expect to stay sort of at the type of levels that we are now for the next few quarters.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYeah, thanks Richard. I think Adrian, this is an interesting question coming in. We have not seen much\\nsuccess of traditional global luxury car OEM’s EVs so far. What's your assessment of what's not working\\nfor them, and how will JLR be different?\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYeah, thanks Balaji. No, so I think the observation behind the question is correct. And you have to segment\\nthe question, I think, and feed it to its different regions. So I'm going to do that, and I'm actually going to\\nfocus the answer on the China region, which is probably the most important changes in NEV, which is BEV\\nand PHEV over the course of the last 12 months or so. It's pretty clear at the moment that industry in\\nChina, for NEV, I say BEV and PHEV, is really focused and concentrated around RMB 400,000 and below.\\nThat's where the industry is taking off. So from the bottom of the product range, if that makes sense.\\nAnd it's pretty clear the data says above those levels, whether you be Daimler with their EQS or BMW\\nwith their IX, above those levels, they are selling much stronger in traditional ICE than they are in BEV at\\nthis point in time. It doesn't mean to say that that those manufacturers are losing share overall. But it\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\ndoes show that the transition above those transacting points, I'd say the RMB400,000 again, hasn't really\\ntaken off as yet. Now for us, our first launches of all BEV, will be MLA, which will go on sale, order later\\nthis year and on sale later next year and into China in 2025, early 2025. I think the most important things\\nfor us is that we launch a brilliant modern luxury product, which we will do. We will continue with our ICE\\nofferings. PHEV actually hasn't taken off in China at these levels. And we will also electrify that product.\\nTwo years down the line, I think it's very difficult to predict exactly what the take up rate will be. But we're\\nconfident so long as we pass the criteria of it being a brilliantly refined, modern luxury, luxurious offering.\\nThen in time, the transition from ICE to BEV will actually happen. So, we're confident with our product\\noffering. We're good with the timeline. People told us for a long time we were too late. We never actually\\nbelieved that. And I think it's starting to show itself a little bit now. But we think we have a complement\\nof power train in our most important products. So, we feel good about our product plan and the\\nintroduction of those BEVs at this point in time.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThank you, Adrian. Shailesh, this is coming your way. In terms of order backlog for your EVs and ICE\\nportfolio, and what should be the industry VME given the kind of moderation and demand that you're\\nstarting to see?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo, as far as order backlog for both EVs and ICE, in general it is, in general the waiting periods are in the\\nrange of 3 weeks to 12 weeks, depending on the model and variant. As far as VME is concerned, the\\nindustry has kind of a tale of two cities. There is the entry segment, which is facing demand pressure, and\\nfor certain manufacturers, the inventory levels are high. So, there is definitely VME pressure, which is\\nbuilding up, especially on the entry side. While on the other hand, the SUVs are going very strong with\\nvery less need for any VME. Fortunately for us, in hatches, as I said, that we are doing well because of our\\nmulti-powertrain strategy. So, as far as we are concerned, our VME has been kept under tight control still.\\nAnd, as and when the competitive situation demands that we need to do certain things for creation of\\ndemand, we will do that.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThanks, Shailesh. I think, Adrian, this is another interesting question coming in. Are you concerned around\\nJLR's cost competitiveness, given the combination of high inflation and stronger GBP in the UK?\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYeah, thanks Balaji. Concerned, no, but I think there's opportunities for us here on cost. I mean, I think\\nwe're on record previously say over the next phase as supply starts to increase and balance out with\\ndemand, which will happen. I mean, that's going to happen may be three, four quarters down the road.\\nThen a couple of things we expect to happen. One, we do expect marketing costs on our vehicles, which\\nare historical lows at this point to actually increase. Our preference would be increasing fixed marketing,\\nbut it's certain on some of our nameplates, variable marketing will increase as well. Not back to previous\\nlevels, by the way, we won't be variable marketing 4%, 5%, and even 6%, which is where we were at a\\npoint in time before COVID, but it will increase. Maybe in total, those costs will increase two or three\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\npercentage points. And I think we feel the opportunity, not for that two or three percentage points to\\nhurt us actually, that they'll generate and stimulate higher demand.\\nBut we do think there's an opportunity on variable costs in three places. One, biggest of which is material\\ncosts for the inflationary items, which you just mentioned and referenced earlier. But we also think as we\\nbuild more cars, which we will do in the second half of the year that will help with our plans, manufacturing\\nefficiencies, as well as the supply costs.\\nAnd we also think there's a little bit more to go in terms of improvements on product quality and warranty\\ncosts as well. So our intention will be to offset those two to three percentage points on marketing with\\ncost reductions of two to three percentage points across those three areas, Balaji.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nThanks, Adrian. Shailesh, I think there's still a lot of clarification that is sought a sort on the EV margins,\\nand can you just go through it once again.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah, I think, a lot is coming from the quarter one result, but I must clarify here that the outlook of margins\\nof EV is very, going to be very strong. And let me, let me just call out some of the tailwinds, which are very\\nclear. One, the cell prices are recovering to the levels where it was in H1 and the impacts should start,\\nbeing felt from this quarter itself, number one. Number two, as I said, that PLI is going to be a big addition\\nto the margin, and we are confident that we are adhering to all the requirements for the eligibility as has\\nbeen laid down by the Ministry. So that is going to be a big one. There's a, localization that we have been\\nworking on for the last two years, and that is going to yield us significant benefits from a cost reduction\\nperspective. As I said, there are new generation aggregates, which are also going to come in this financial\\nyear, which are at significantly lower costs. And therefore, I'm very confident that in the medium term,\\nwithin this year, I would say with all the combination of all these factors, the outlook for margin of EV\\nbusiness is going to be very strong.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nLinked to that to a few questions on the ecosystem of EV, including service technicians, etc, dealerships,\\ncharging network. Can you spend some time on that?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah, so Balaji, today we have a shop-in-shop concept in the existing dealers. And the chart that you had\\nshown in the presentation earlier shows that with the launch of Tiago EV, there has been a shift in terms\\nof micro markets now. More than 49% of the sales of Tiago EV kind of a product is coming from other than\\nthe top 20 cities. And therefore, we have taken that opportunity to really start expanding our network in\\nthose smaller cities through a shop-in-shop concept. And going forward, we also want to separate, ICE as\\nwell as the EV showrooms, as and when we see the volumes in certain cities, which go to a certain level\\nwhere the separate channel becomes viable. As we are expanding in these cities, we are also therefore\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nbuilding the service capability from an infra perspective as well as also training the service engineers for\\nthose service stations. So, that is also an ongoing process. I believe I have covered both the points.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYes, you did. Thank you. And Adrian, this is coming your way in terms of the order book. Yeah, the 185,000\\nthat you called out, there's a drop from 200K to 185K, but the same time that the percentage of Range\\nRover Sports, Defender has remained constant at 76%. Can you throw some color on that? One and maybe\\nI'll ask the second question as well. The Land Rover brand can you confirm how much of the sales are\\nactually coming from existing customers and as this has been any material change or anything to read\\nthere?\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYes, Okay. So on your first question, throwing any light on that look, we have for a particular period seen\\nbeyond the three vehicle lines, the order banks, for the other vehicles, bearing in mind we've been\\nbuilding not very many at all, the order banks, the other vehicles have started to fall over the last 12-18\\nmonths. I give you a data point. When we had pre-COVID, we would have had about 50,000 to 60,000\\noutside of the big three orders. It's now down to 40,000. So in total, order banks for those non-3 Range\\nRover, Range Rover Sport and Defender have consistently dropped over the last 9 to 12 months. One,\\nbecause we haven't prioritized build. And two, because, and two by the way, because we now refreshed\\nthe vehicles - Discovery Sport and Evoque also. So that's what's been happening in terms of the existing\\norder book.\\nIn terms of the loyalty, I'll just give you a data reference, because I don't have all of that data, but Range\\nRover has the highest loyalty in any brand at the moment, 41% actually of existing vehicle owners are\\nthen going to buy the Range Rover product. The Range Rover itself has higher loyalty rates than our other\\nbrands.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nGot it. Richard, what would be the effective tax rate that we should assume for JLR?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nTax rate this quarter is 26%. At the moment we have a deferred tax asset that's not on the balance sheet.\\nUK long-term tax rates are 25%.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nI think there's another question. I will take it in terms of, are there any obstacles that are stopping us from\\nactually stepping up our guidance or changing our guidance? What are we thinking about the guidance\\npiece there?\\nI think when we reflected on it, it was simple, just three months have passed in the quarter. We would\\njust want to get more clarity on the year before we are able to touch around guidance. You know that\\nfrom a delivery perspective our plan is the strategy hasn't changed, execution hasn't changed. We want\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nto keep executing it. And the numbers, I think once we have a better handle on the year we can talk about\\nit, otherwise it'll be a bit premature.\\nYeah, and Girish, this is coming your way. Just on the BS6 Phase 2 transition, have we now fully\\ntransitioned, how should we view the performance of the segment from a volume and market share\\nperspective?\\nGirish Wagh\\nSo, I think I gave some color on this. So, yes, we have transitioned the entire portfolio to BS6 Phase 2. And\\nwhile doing so, we did make a lot of changes in the vehicle, including the platform, the power-to-weight\\nratios, the new technologies being added, as also some of the new value enhancement that we have given\\nin this product. The basic purpose behind doing this is to increase the value that we will continue to\\ndeliver. This was a major transition point which we have leveraged to add these value enhancers in the\\nproduct.\\nNow, going ahead, as I said, we will leverage the higher value being delivered. We will communicate that\\nvalue. We will establish that value on the ground, which will be used towards realization improvement.\\nSo, the customer is going to get higher value, and I think with this kind of product superiority, we will also\\nbe able to get our market shares back, so that's the plan going ahead. Balaji.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYes. Thank you. And Richard, this is coming your way. There are a few questions around this, particularly\\nthe 110 bps that we have called out as one-off and saying the underlying is more like 7.5%, implication of\\ninventorization of costs onto the balance sheet. Can you just give some clarity on that?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nYes, sure. So, I've mentioned beforehand, we produced 103,000 units in quarter. We wholesaled 93,000.\\nSo, we have stock going up by 10,000 units. That stock is valued on the balance sheet and its material\\ncosts plus some proportion of manufacturing costs. So, that manufacturing costs for those vehicles sits on\\nthe balance sheet, not in the P&L. And that's what gives us a positive in the quarter. When those vehicles\\nare sold, that will reverse back out. So it's a timing impact of the stock buildup that we have. Hope that\\nexplains it.\\nP. B. Balaji\\nYeah, I think we're now coming to the end of the questions. There are one or two. Let me pick up some\\nof those. One is a question on cash, saying that we are having GBP4 billion of cash at JLR and Rs. 8,000\\ncrores of cash at domestic. Don't you think as a company, you're holding high levels of cash?\\nI think our plan is to go to net debt free, and therefore we will look at all opportunities to see what are\\nthe best way to handle this cash. So we will keep working on that.\\nAnd again, a same point on net debt. Do you believe that given your future cash flow generation, do you\\nthink you'll be net debt free earlier?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJuly 25, 2023\\n\\nRepeat the same answer. Let's wait for another quarter or two before we are able to confirm that. We've\\njust started the year. We'd want to place a few more quarters before we do it.\\nI mean, I think with this we are now more or less done with the questions that are there. I'm not able to\\nsee anything that is new that is coming out. If there's one question on Tata Technologies IPO, saying that\\nwhat's the timing that you have for that?\\nWe just got the approval from the DRHP perspective from SEBI. We are working through the points that\\nare there. And at an appropriate time, we'll let you know.\\nSo, I think with this, we are done with any questions, anything on WhatsApp, anything that's come\\nthrough, nothing, right?\\nSo thanks a lot, all of you. Thanks a lot to my colleagues in JLR, colleagues here around the room, as well\\nas people who have joined on the call. Really appreciate your probing questions, and thanks a lot for your\\nsupport.

Firstly, welcome all of you for the Q4 FY23 analyst call, and our intention is to quickly run you\\nthrough the numbers and any color that we may want to give, and then spend as much time as possible\\non the Q&A as normal. A standard Safe harbor statement, nothing delta to report this time. Go to the next\\nslide please.\\nA pretty action-packed quarter both here as well as in JLR. And we were there at Auto Expo, which we\\ngave a bit of color on last results call. And on top of that we also had the launch of the Tiago EV and\\nShailesh, I'm sure he is going to talk about that. We finished the first 10,000 sales of Tiago EV already. And\\nwe also completed the purchase of Ford Sanand facility, that has been done. And the final tranche of Rs.\\n3,750 crores has also been received from the TPG Rise. And overall, on the e-mobility space as well as the\\nzero-emission mobility space a lot of work happening, and portfolio continued to increase.Next slide.\\nThat's in India, into JLR, again an equally action packed quarter, where starting point is announcement of\\nthe blockbuster, the Range Rover BEV, launching next year for which booking start from October this year.\\nAnd also we started talking about the Jaguar BEV launches as well, which I am sure Adrian and Richard\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nwill talk about. We also talked about a long-term investment plan under our Reimagine, for a GBP 15\\nbillion investment over the next five years, and the whole electrification roadmap continues to accelerate.\\nAt the same time a very fundamental call on the House of Brands, where we will amplify the individual\\nbrands that's Range Rover, Defender, Discovery, and Jaguar in a big way, while continuing to be almost\\nequivalent of an Intel inside as far as the Land Rover is concerned, and its features, I'm sure there will be\\na lot of questions on that, which we can pick up both today as well as in the Investor Day coming up. Next\\nslide.\\nFair to say it has been an extremely satisfying quarter. And the reason I say, use that word is that, nice to\\nsee all the auto verticals coming together once again and this time with a lot of intensity as well. So both\\nthe alignment of the vectors are there and the magnitude of vectors are also increasing, which is what has\\ntranslated into a strong set of numbers for the quarters, resulting on multiple highs and I will quickly cover\\nthat in the coming slides. We ended the year on a pretty strong note with revenue of around Rs. 1 lakh\\ncrores with an EBITDA of 13.3%, and the profit before tax and exceptional item of Rs. 5,000 crores.\\nOn a full-year basis, we hit our highest ever revenue at around Rs. 3.5 lakh crores and ended the year with\\na positive free cash flow of Rs. 7,800 crores, despite a very weak start in Q1 and Q2, which you see in the\\nnumbers. The business has been sequentially improving its performance and doing it in significant\\nstretches. So, very happy with the way we have ended. Next slide please.\\nSource of growth, in the quarter we grew by about 35%, of which volume and mix contributed 24% of the\\n35% and the price came in at 10.5%, so price is still a very strong variable in our growth agenda.\\nProfitability 3.2% went to 6.8% and all businesses contributing to it and JLR coming at a very large swing\\nthere, contributing to the 2.8% out of that delta there. Again debt continues to reduce at Rs. 43,700 crores\\nand TML India at Rs. 6,200 crores, JLR GBP 3 billion i.e. Rs. 30,000 crores we talk about. So the FY24 net\\ndebt reduction plan, we are confirming, we will not be in a position to meet the FY24 numbers, but very\\nclearly - FY25 we want this issue sorted out. Next slide.\\nA series of headlines, normally we don't do that, but it's fair to just pull back and reflect on what this\\nquarter and the year actually means for the Group. For us, each one of us in this call, we feel strongly\\nabout this, the highest-ever revenue in a quarter, the highest-ever EBITDA in a quarter, one of the\\nstrongest PBTs that we delivered and all three auto vertical simultaneously profitable, strong net debt\\nreduction. That's all the quarter numbers. And if you factor in that the first half was a very weak first half,\\nwe still delivered the highest-ever revenue. We have the highest EBITDA since 2015, very strong PBT\\ndespite the weak start, after factoring the weak start. And India net debt lowest in the last 15 years, so\\nit's worthwhile just to mull over it to say, I would say, that the potential of this business is slowly starting\\nto come out and that's what we would want to build on when we go into FY24. This is basically giving us\\nthe impetus to how we want to play at FY24. Next slide.\\nThis is also something which we are happy about, a dividend of Rs. 2 per share for the ordinary\\nshareholders and Rs. 2.1 for the DVR shareholders, coming in after sometime. And this will obviously have\\nto be a - the Board has recommended this and this will have to be approved in the ensuing shareholders\\nmeeting. And this will result in a cash flow of Rs. 771 crores as part of the plan i.e. this is factored into the\\ndebt reduction plan in any case. So again, very happy to see this. This has been a key demand for the retail\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nshareholders and I always maintained a turnaround is not complete unless we pay dividends and nice to\\nsee this number coming through as well. Next slide.\\nWith this, I think let me hand it over to Richard who will walk you through the numbers and between him\\nand Adrian, they will cover the JLR section. Richard, over to you.\\nRichard Molyneux:\\nGreat. So, Balaji has already explained some of the positive future announcements for JLR, so I get the\\nchance to go through some positive historical financials as well. So if we go to the next chart left hand side\\nof this is last year by quarter. So if you look through retail sales, very glad to see us back over 100,000\\nunits of retail sales for the quarter, that's up 20% versus Q3, and up 30% year-on-year.\\nIf you look through all of the financial metrics on this chart, through revenue, EBIT down to free cash flow.\\nNote that each and every metric improves in each and every quarter. So we have demonstrated strong\\nconsistent growth through the year. In Q4, our revenue GBP7.1billion, that is our highest revenue that we\\nhave seen since FY19. EBITDA of 14.6%, 6.5% EBIT, strong PBT and GBP850 million worth of cash in the\\nquarter. In fact, if you look at the second half of the year, we generated GBP1.3 billion worth of cash, that\\nalso is the strongest H2 cash performance for seven years, so since FY16. A strong performance in Q4. If\\nyou look at the full year, although there is some movement back in retails, that is the natural effect of\\ndealers destocking when we had tight supply and restocking now that supply is coming back on stream.\\nRevenue was GBP23 billion, we produced 2.4% EBIT of the year, PBT was negative 64, but if you look\\nthrough that, just like the old added game of two halves, our PBT in the first half of the year was minus\\nGBP 697 million, in the second half of the year it was positive GBP 633 million. Free cash flow for the year\\nGBP 521 million, also the best full-year cash flow since FY16. And we ended the year with GBP 3.8 billion\\nworth of cash, GBP 5.3 billion worth of liquidity, and GBP 3 billion worth of net debt. So we have had, like\\nI say, a strong consistent year. We do exit the year performing well. We also have an order bank, which\\ncurrently stands at 200,000 units to assist us as we go to the start of this year. Okay, next chart.\\nI won't read through this, this is a written version of most of the comments that I've made, feel free to\\nread it at your leisure afterwards, so if we go again. So, this is our wholesale performance. So wholesales\\nfor the quarter, 95,000 units, 19% up on the previous quarter and that's been driven by a much more\\nstable and expanding production system. So our production actually increased from 83,000 units in Q3 to\\n98,000 units in Q4. So that's also up 18%. And that's what’s allowed us to increase our wholesales and\\nmeet our customer demand in the period.\\nThe balance of our wholesales remains reasonably consistent, circa 50% of them are Range Rover, Range\\nRover Sport, Evoque, etc. Defender is another 25%, so 75%-76% between those two brands. Full-year\\nbasis the analysis is the same,50% Range Rover, 25% Defender. You’ll note we're still selling 43,000\\nJaguars, we are still making sure that those cars stay current. We’ve invested in technology on the F-PACE.\\nWe’ve invested in special additions to mark the 75th an’iversary of Jaguar as a sports car manufacturer.\\nSo we still are investing in those brands as well. Full-year, 321,000 wholesales. Next chart.\\nSo, if you look at this on a regional basis, you'll see reasonably strong through each region in the quarter,\\nthe one exception I'll call out and explain is North America, that’s not an issue of fundamental demand,\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nthat's just our allocation timing. So although it looks like a reduction there, when you look at retails in\\nNorth America quarter-on-quarter, it was 23,600 in Q3 22,300 in Q4, so hardly changed. And our customer\\norder bank in North America is flat quarter-on-quarter. So that isn't a fundamental change in the demand\\nsignal from North America, it's just our timing of allocations. All other regions strong, including China,\\nprogressed in Q4 as well. Full year, very similar picture, I won't go through that. Worth saying on the righthand side that the proportion of our electrified vehicle is increasing. If you look at the BEV and the PHEV\\nsection at the bottom from 11% to 17%, that's the result of our, I'd say, increasingly compelling PHEV\\noffers. So we have increased both the range and the performance of several of the PHEVs in the range\\nand that is starting to show through in the market, along with the removal of some supply constraints that\\nhave impacted that. So we have had significant increase in the share of PHEV from vehicles in our\\nwholesales. Next chart.\\nOkay, so in terms of the financial walk, this takes PBT from the same quarter last year, where it was GBP9\\nmillion to this quarter GBP 368 million. The biggest variable is volume and mix. And you can see there,\\nprobably worth mentioning that mix is a higher effect than volume. And this comes back to some of the\\nissues around quality of sales, that we've been pushing during the past few months and we'll continue to\\npush. So, that mix is driven by Range Rover and Range Rover Sport, but it is also driven by trim mix within\\nour ranges and making sure that we are continuing to allocate those chips and components that we have\\nto the vehicles which are most favourable for them. So, volume and mix very favourable. If you look at\\npricing and material cost together, this is the picture that I expected to happen and I told you would\\nhappen when we sat down last quarter. So we’ve moved to a position where our output inflation in terms\\nof our pricing is now higher than our input inflation. That wasn’t the case last quarter. Last quarter pricing\\nwith GBP165 million favorable, material cost was GBP230 million adverse. So we've flipped that through\\nthe quarter and we intend for that to continue.\\nGoing through to SG&A, another care point there for us, SG&A is increasing, that is partly marketing, as\\nwe start to move to a scenario where we do want to trigger some more demand at the back end of this\\ncoming year. And also partly the investments in our transformation, particularly in terms of our digital\\ntransformation as a company. Operational FX did exactly what you would expect it to do, on a quarterby-quarter basis, Sterling has weakened, that helps us from a transactional basis but does give us a hit in\\nterms of realized FX and unrealized commodities. The weakening of sterling versus the dollar gave us a\\nfavourable revaluation on our dollar-denominated loans which you can also expect. So, fundamentally the\\nmove in PBT quarter-to-quarter is volume to mix -- volume and mix and we've managed to offset input\\ninflation and output inflation.\\nNext chart. So this looks then at the move of that PBT through to cash, and look key here is in the middle\\nsection of here, cash profit after tax and investment is favourable GBP400million in the quarter. Working\\ncapital continues to move in our favour, that is partly natural as our business expands, our payables\\nexpand faster than our receivables. But also partly from some deliberate measures and initiatives that we\\nput in place, using fairly advanced digital techniques, for example, to reduce our component inventory\\nduring the period. So that is partly natural and partly from some deliberate efforts on our side, generated\\ntheGBP815 million worth of free cash flow that we reported. And next chart.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nIn terms of investment, so total investment for the year was just under GBP2.4 billion, that is an increase.\\nThe biggest part of that increase is in engineering, which rose from GBP1.3 billion to GBP1.7 billion. That's\\na natural part of our product cycle. And you know that we have a large series of launches coming between\\nthe end of next year and 2026. Those are at the high point of the engineering at the moment. So that's\\nwhat’s driving that expense up a bit. What you also see is that as those programs go through their various\\ngateways and start to move to production. They get more capitalized, so our capitalization ratio is slowly\\nincreasing, it was 53% in the quarter versus 48% last quarter and for the full year it was 45% versus, sorry\\n43% versus 35% last year. We would expect that capitalization to continue to increase probably to around\\nthe 60% range. We've also said, Balaji repeated this earlier on, that this investment number will increase.\\nWe are expecting it to be around GBP3 billion a year for the next five years, as we continue to invest in\\nboth our electrified vehicles, electrified powertrains themselves and the electrical systems that support\\nthem. Okay. Next chart.\\n\\nRight Now move on to a business update. If we move forward, but this chart which shows our average\\nrevenue per unit is really important and part of the demonstration of our journey towards modern luxury.\\nSo we've managed to increase our average revenue consistently over the last five years in FY'23 it moved\\nup fromGBP62,000 to GBP71,000 so up by about 15%. Part of that is the increased production of Range\\nRover / Range Rover Sport. But even within the vehicle lines, we have continued to increase our focus on\\nthe higher-level trends. Including, for example, SV, so the Range Rover SV which was only launched\\nOctober 21, already got 6,100 orders at an average transaction price of GBP180,000. We've even been\\ntesting the water north of that, we did a special edition Landsdown edition of the Range Rover SV, which\\ntransacted at around GBP250,000. So there is room for us to operate in this space, if we continue with\\ndiligence, our modern luxury journey. Next page.\\nIn terms of semiconductors, I think people have people have mentioned this a lot. My summary I think is\\nprobably three things. We are seeing fewer issues now, they’ve not completely disappeared, but we are\\nseeing fewer of them. Our ability to see them in advance is improving due to our relationships with the\\nchip manufacturers and with our suppliers. And when we do spot them, the number of tools at our\\ndisposals to solve those problems is increasing. So they are proving less of a, I'm going to say nuisance,\\nthat’s probably an understatement than they were last year and they could still come back to bite us, but\\nit is considerably improving. Next chart.\\nOkay, key for us is to make sure that we are progressively and in a stable manner, bringing our supply up\\nto continue to build our order bank down, just to meet our customers' expectations with the arrival of\\ntheir vehicles that they wanted. We are showing good progress in terms of getting Range Rover and Range\\nRover Sport through our facility in Solihull, went up 2,600 units per week during Q4, and we expect that\\nrise to continue progressively as we go through next year, pushing north of 3,000 units per week during\\nthe year. Next chart.\\nInflation is still an issue for us. We do have considerable headwinds, we’ve shown them here at GBP850\\nmillion for the year, of which about 40% are commodity prices and about a third were semiconductors,\\nthe rest is energy and labour cost both with us and with our supply base. So we knew these were coming\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nand we spent a large portion of last year, doubling down on our Refocus savings and can proudly say, that\\nwe've offset that and more than offset that in terms of our Refocus savings during the year. A lot of that\\nwas very detailed work in terms of making sure that we allocated those chips that we had to the vehicles\\nthat we wanted to sell. But there was also considerable work done on the cost side, on the investment\\nside, and on the inventory side. So in total, we delivered GBP 1.1 billion in savings through the Refocus\\nprograms and that did offset the inbound inflation that we saw during the year. Next chart.\\nSo China, so we are really proud of the results of our China business, it’s best financial results for five\\nyears. And if you look at the left-hand side, segments of the market that we’re operating in are relatively\\nstable. Our share of those segments is also relatively stable. So look, we know that market is really fast\\nmoving, really dynamic in the sections that we're operating in, we are maintaining our share. If you look\\nat the financials on the right-hand side, it looks a little bit as if imports average revenue per unit isn't\\nincreasing as much as the global, that's a little bit of a misconception there is some profit from our P&A\\noperation, our or after-sales operation. If you look purely at vehicle average sales per unit, for imported\\nvolume it is up 8% year-over-year. From a profitability standpoint, we were PBT positive in the quarter of\\n13% EBITDA, 2% EBIT. On a full-year basis we were also PBT positive and EBIT and EBITDA were both 5%\\nhigher than FY22. So very good consistent progress within our China business, best financial year for five\\nyears. Next chart.\\nRight, the fun pictures. We're continuing to develop our product range. If you look at the '24 model, year\\nVelar on the right-hand side, that is –that’s as close to a flawless execution of our modernist design\\nlanguage that you're going to get. It's just beautiful. We have made some tweaks to the exterior. We've\\nmade some technology upgrades, for example, the PHEV now has a 20% higher range than it did\\nbeforehand it goes 40 miles WLTP without charge. And on the interior look, there are also some upgrades.\\nSo that vehicle is upgraded. And, on the right is the Range Rover Sport SV, you will want one, they are\\ngoing to be phenomenal. And as I’ve mentioned before and we're extremely proud of the success of our\\nRange Rover SV, and we've received 6,100 orders for that. We haven't even announced or started taking\\norders for this one yet. Next chart.\\nSo looking ahead, we are optimistic, so we exited FY'23 in a much stronger position than we started it. So\\nwe're on the right trajectory, and we have had strong and consistent progress. So we think FY'24 is going\\nto be a good year for us. In reality, the first half may be a little bit slower, so I expect the second half of\\nthe year to be stronger than the first half. But we do have the momentum that we're looking for and we\\nwill have a good year. Our priorities is to continue to build our supply availability, our robustness, the\\naccuracy with which we give our suppliers our forecasts. We'll continue to focus on brand activation, there\\nis a lead-time with that, we have to start doing some of that now, to activate orders towards the back end\\nof the year. We're going to execute our plans. And from a financial perspective, we're saying we're going\\nto deliver 6% plus EBIT. GBP2 billion free cash flow after investment, which means our net debt will reduce\\nfrom GBP3 billion at the end of the financial year just finished, to circa GBP1 billion, 12 months from now.\\nThat's it from my side. I'm sure we'll take some questions afterwards, but thanks very much for the\\nmeantime.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Thanks, Richard. So quickly moving on to commercial vehicles, next slide please.\\nThe registration market shares after the correction to the approach to a demand-pull strategy is now\\nstarting to recover. Our Q4 better than Q3, barring one which is the – what used to be called intermediate\\nand light commercial vehicles, MGV’s is where we still need to get some further impetus on that. Very\\nmuch part of the plan that Girish and team are working towards. But everywhere everything else starting\\nto sequentially start improving. Next slide.\\nOn overall volumes, the call-out here is the powertrain mix that you see, with the CNG prices now coming\\nunder policy, and therefore expecting some stabilization in terms of the delta between that and diesel,\\none would expect to see the CV numbers, sorry CNG numbers starting to change as well. Next slide.\\nOverall revenues, happy that we ended the quarter with a double-digit EBITDA, something that we said\\nwe want to get to as soon as possible. And the business ended the year pretty strong with revenue of\\naround Rs. 21,000 crores and an EBITDA of 10.1%, and clearly, with market share starting to inch-up as\\nwell as profitability starting to improve, the business is in the right track. Further distance to go, but very\\nmuch on track. Next slide.\\nThe source of money that you are seeing, where the profitability came from - volume, mix, realizations,\\nsavings, all coming through quite nicely. And we intend to keep it this way as we go forward. So the other\\nbig one is the consumer-facing metrics, which is a very, very important on a demand-pull strategy to\\nensure that the brand is in a strong wicket, very happy with the way things are starting to move. The brand\\nis – with the interventions coming through, be it the power – the brand power, the consideration top box,\\ntop of mind awareness, all trending in the right direction and some very good numbers even at a\\ngeographical level as well. And of course, the dealer satisfaction, as well as the composite satisfaction\\nscore doing pretty well.\\nSo let me give it to Girish to give an overall update on the business. Girish?\\nGirish Wagh\\nYeah. Thanks, Balaji. So, I think the industry continued its growth in volumes, and one saw growth of 22%\\nover the same quarter last year. And in annual terms a growth of almost 34%. During the year we launched\\nmore than 40 new products and 150 variants, in addition to what we had unveiled in the Auto Expo. As\\nBalaji mentioned, we had highest annual and quarterly revenue for FY’23 and Q4 of FY’23. And I think as\\nwe started our discount reduction strategy from Q3, and as we continued ahead, we were able to grow\\nour Vahan share, the registration share in Q4 versus Q3. With focus on continuously improving the\\nproduct and service competitiveness, as well as our communication to the customer. I think the nonvehicle business which has been a significant area of focus grew by almost 33%. And both spares and\\nservice penetration has been continuously improving for last three years now. With all this, the EBIT\\nimproved sequentially and is now highest in 21 quarters, with most of it coming from discount pullback,\\npart of it from cost reduction and also commodities softening, which happened in H2. While the entire\\nindustry grew by 22% vs Q4 FY22 and 34% over the last year, I think the good part was significant growth\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nin the medium and heavy commercial vehicles, almost 52% over the last year. And the passenger segment,\\nespecially the buses, which were almost down and out during COVID, has seen a very good growth, finally\\nin the year gone by.\\nI think as Balaji showed some metrics, our continuous focus to improve the brand health through judicious\\nmix of ATL communication, Digital communication, and also lot of influencer advocacy has actually led to\\na good improvement in net promoter score. And in fact net promoter score has reached the highest-ever\\nlevel now to 71 and the brand power also grew by 170 bps. So, I think both at a very good levels. We have\\ntransitioned the entire portfolio to BS6 Phase II and in line with our philosophy, once again we have gone\\nbeyond near compliance to the regulations. And across the range in each and every product, we have\\nfurther strengthened the superiority in terms of the total cost of ownership, comfort and convenience,\\nconnectivity in terms of Fleet Edge, as well as the safety features, which have been added especially in\\nthe trucks.\\nOn the CNG, interestingly, I think with the new guideline, apart from reduction in the CNG prices, I think\\nthe biggest uncertainty which was in the minds of the customers was about the difference in CNG prices\\nwith respect to diesel, and for that matter, even petrol. And this uncertainty had led to drop in CNG\\nvolumes significantly. So, with this new pricing guideline, not only the CNG prices have dropped, but it is\\nalso getting pegged with diesel, which will gradually start bringing in good certainty in the minds of the\\ncustomer and we will see the CNG penetration increase. Towards this, I think we have a very strong CNG\\nportfolio, both in ILCV as well as MCVs, and last year we launched our CNG vehicles and heavy trucks, as\\nalso our intra portfolio. So, I think we have CNG presence across the portfolio now.\\nGoing ahead for this quarter as well as FY’24, I think we will continue our focus on the retail now. And\\nregistration shares is what will drive us, and we will continue the realization improvement journey. As I\\nhave said, I think the BS6 Phase II products have come up with a lot of value enhancements, features, and\\nperformance improvement. And there will be a lot of efforts to communicate this not just to the\\ncustomers, but also other stakeholders who play a very important role in decision-making. And therefore\\nthere will be a lot of influencer advocacy as well as actual in-field trials. Getting into this year, I think we\\nwill now start scaling up EV supplies with the supply chain being resolved, FAME certification clarity being\\nthere and both on ACE-EV as well as the electric buses, which are meant for the CESL tender. Downstream\\nbusiness will continue to grow being a focus area for us. And in international markets we will continue to\\nplay safe. We will maintain or grow market shares, ensure that margin and channel health is protected.\\nAnd we will also see some of the new markets which we can enter during the year. Next slide.\\nComing to the electric mobility, so I think we have completed all our electric bus deliveries meant to be\\ndone, to Delhi Transport Corporation and Nagpur city. In addition to that, we have already started delivery\\nof the CESL first tender with the Delhi Transport Corporation buses. And in addition to that, also a few\\nretail customers or orders that we have received. We have delivered more than 300 ACE electric vehicles\\nin fourth quarter. And here on, we can start ramping up significantly, as I said earlier, with clarity on supply\\nchain as well as the FAME certification.\\nI think in Auto Expo, we made a clear statement on our future roadmap, in terms of net-zero greenhouse\\ngas emissions and the de carbonization plan with the display of 14 product concepts. On the smart city\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nmobility, as I said, I think the concession agreements have been signed with Delhi Transport Corporation\\nfor 1,500 buses. The supply has already been initiated, which will be followed by Bangalore, for more than\\n900 buses, and then Jammu and Kashmir for 200 buses. I think now our e-bus fleet has crossed more than\\n7 crore or 70 million kilometers. And we have been able to maintain more than 95% uptime in FY23. So\\nwe have been delivering better than the contractual conditions. The operational revenue has also been\\nahead of our own internal budget, doing well at around Rs. 500 crores.\\nComing to the digital businesses, so Fleet Edge continues to do very well. Now with more than 390,000\\nconnected trucks towards the end of FY23, and the monthly active usage is continuously increasing and\\ncustomers are seeing a lot of value in terms of improvement in vehicle uptime, asset utilization, is also\\nhelping them for better tracking and optimizing the usage and driving habits, leading to improvement in\\nthe total cost of ownership. So, I think the clear benefits, which are being seen, as a result of which I think\\nthe penetration is continuously increasing. And in fact, I’m happy to share that from April 1, we have also\\nintroduced the subscription model for the Fleet Edge. And we have seen a very good encouraging\\nresponse to this model.\\nAs I said, the engagement time has been improving consistently with the benefits being experienced by\\nthe fleet owners, as well as the drivers. E-Dukaan, which is our online spare parts marketplace, grew better\\nthan what we had targeted, in fact, it grew 2.8 times, although on lower base, but doing pretty well and\\nwe also extended E-Dukaan for diesel exhaust fluid as well as lubricants. So this will help us to grow these\\ntwo business lines also.\\nI think digital lead generation has been a focus area for us and this has helped us, not just to generate\\nleads, but also communicate our brand message, product competitiveness and other aspects. This has led\\nto improved brand health and therefore augurs very well for the future.

One additional data point which we’ve pulled in this time is the EV financials, where there is been\\na lot of queries that you've been asking. I also see a question, say if I need to add EV plus PV, it doesn’t\\nadd up to this one, there are some intercompany that need to be canceled of as well, as part of\\nconsolidation. On the revenues – this business is now making an EBITDA loss of about Rs. 350 odd crores.\\nOut of the Rs. 350 odd crore, that’s the 4.6% negative that you see there. Out of Rs. 350 crores, Rs. 300\\ncrores is product development costs that are being charged-off .And therefore this business is almost\\nEBITDA neutral and this needs to be seen in the context of a run-away increases in lithium prices. The\\nreason I bring it out is that, we believe the EV from a sustainable profitability perspective is in the right\\ntrack. This does not include any PLI credits or anything that is being accrued. So this is underlying\\nprofitability I’m referring to. A $1 billion business – roughly a $1 billion business with broadly neutral\\nEBITDA that is where we are, on an underlying basis. Next slide.\\nThese are obvious, only thing, why is the structural fixed cost going up there, substantial increase in FME,\\nas you see the brands building up, there is also element of IPL phasing that will be there, as we go ahead\\nof that. Employee cost is basically investments that are happening in the EV business and D&A expenses\\nagain, as the product investments pickup up there. So all these are good investments that are happening\\nfor the long-term viability of the business.\\nNext slide. Let me give it to Shailesh.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nThank you, Balaji. So let me start with the key highlights of the industry first. So FY23 for the industry was\\nthe highest ever since the last highest ever which was in FY19 which was 3.4 million, this year ended at\\n3.9 million, which was nearly 27% growth versus FY22. SUVs continue to increase in terms of share,\\nincreased by 300 bps to 43%. And EV’s - industry saw phenomenal growth of 170% with several new\\nlaunches and increasing acceptance of EV among customers.\\nAs far as Tata Motors PV and EV business is concerned, this was our highest-ever wholesale year, which\\nwas nearly 5.4 lakh volumes, with the Vahan market share of 13.5%. This is nearly 45% growth as\\ncompared to FY22, which was, if you just compare with industry growth, which was 27%. Our EV sales\\ncrossed a major milestone of 50,000, this includes about 2,200 volumes that we did in international\\nbusiness. Vahan market share was around 84%, despite increasing competition. We have already\\nmentioned that in PV business we grew by 45% as compared to FY’22, but it was a growth of 150% in the\\nEV business for us. We were the number one SUV manufacturer in FY23 and Nexon was the number one\\nproduct in the SUV segment.\\nGoing forward, what are the bright spots, we clearly see that there are several new launches happening\\nin the SUV space, which will augur well for the growth in this financial year. CNG demand with the prices\\ncoming down is also expected to pick up, and several new launches happening in the EV space and\\nincreasing acceptance of EV’s, I think this will also augur well for the EV segment. For Tata Motors, very\\nhappy to see that we transitioned to BS6 Phase II early February itself, and that has really helped us to\\nensure a very smooth transition. Several new launches, which are going to drive demand, Nexon EV Max,\\nin hashtag version has been receiving very good response. We recently launched it. This month, we are\\nalso launching the twin cylinder technology in Altroz, which is Altroz iCNG, which retains the entire boot\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And of course, this year we’ll see some\\nof our products going through the mid-cycle enhancement.\\nWe have few players in certain segments – we are only one player in at least one segment where we are\\nstill in diesel segment. And that should also help us improve our sales in the diesel side. Talking about\\nsome of the challenges or headwinds, mainly the entry side of the PV industry which is hatches and sedan,\\nis – has been under pressure for some time. The channel inventory, as compared to where we started the\\nlast financial year in FY22, is at a higher level. Pent-up demand clearly has gone down, barring certain new\\nlaunches in a few popular SUVs. And recently price increase has been taken by OEMs to basically offset\\nthe cost increases which have happened because of the RDE transition. So this might –we have to watch\\nthe impact of this. From Tata Motors side, the way we are preparing ourselves is to focus on demand\\ngeneration through micro-market focus and actions to improve the conversion rates. We are growing our\\nportfolio both on CNG and EV, both are expected to see good growth this year, and therefore we should\\nbe the beneficiary of that. And of course, we’re driving margin improvement through an institutionalized\\ncost-reduction initiative, as well as what we have as internal nomenclature nine-box framework. So both\\non margin as well as demand generation, we have clear action plans laid out.\\nBack to you Balaji.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you, Shailesh. Next slide, please.\\nOkay, perfect. So moving on to the overall CV+PV. Investments, we ended the year with Rs. 6,400 crores\\nof investment spending, and this is likely to increase to Rs. 8,000 crores next year, as we step-up the whole\\nelectrification investments both in CV and PV. That’s the main trust of those delta that is coming through.\\nNext slide.\\nOn the cash flows, overall the operating – the cash profit after tax and capex. I see in the questions, some\\nof the doubts lingering in terms of – as how do we treat Capex? Let me be clear, for us what we call out\\nas free cash flows, is operating cash, less Capex, less working capital changes and any finance expenses\\nthat we incur, so it’s the entirety of it. So this is the free cash flow after all these investments. This year\\nwe ended at Rs. 3, 800 crores of free cash flows for this quarter (Q4 FY23). And then the full year we ended\\nat Rs. 2, 400 crores of free cash flows after all these investments. And hearteningly, all the Capex is funded\\nby the cash profit after tax, so it’s extremely self-sustaining business that we have. On a full-year basis,\\nworking capital in Q4 normally reverses. Full-year basis no impact at all as working capital, so what we are\\nseeing is Rs. 2,400 crores is completely cash profit after tax, less Capex, less finance expenses. Next slide.\\nTata Motors Finance, we did signal that this business, the entire restructured portfolio we want to have a\\nvery, very close watch on it. And two things have happened this quarter. One is, we have taken a hard\\nlook at the restructured book and taken adequate provisions to ensure that this book now completely is\\ntaken care of. And we started off the concerted collection efforts and that has ensured that the GNPA is\\nnow starting to sharply trend down. We did 2.6% in this quarter and the absolute numbers of GNPA are\\nalso starting to come down sharply, and we will intend to maintain that. And the capital adequacy remains\\ncomfortable even at these levels. And the business is now pivoting squarely to quality, focusing on\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

And headwinds, tailwinds,\\nlet me give it on to Shailesh to talk about, because that’s also coming through in one other question as\\nwell.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSure. So as far as, let me talk first about the ICE segment. As far as tailwinds are concerned, I think what\\nis really going to support growth are going to be the new launches, refreshes that will been launched by\\nthe various OEMs in this financial year. We are still seeing the demand in terms of bookings for the\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nindustry are remaining strong. So that’s a good news that demand has not dropped. Of course, there are\\ncertain segments, especially in the entry segment, which I mentioned, is under pressure and bit of interest\\nrates even now also impacting the vehicle financing interest rates and all. We’ll have some impact or\\ndefinitely again on the entry segment. As far as EVs are concerned there is hardly any headwinds that I\\nsee, I only see the tailwinds. There are several launches, which are going to happen in this space, and that\\nis going to expand in the market. There is a growing acceptance of EVs among the consumers, and that is\\ncontinuing to help. We are seeing every quarter the industry is growing big in size. In fact, if you really see\\nthe monthly rate of sales of EVs has grown to 8,500 to 9,000 per month for the industry, which is very\\nhigh, just one week back it would have been 4,000 or so. So I believe that EV industry will have all these\\ntailwinds apart from the various states which are also coming with very progressive policies. PLI and all, I\\nthink the environment is very favorable for EV’s.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you, Shailesh. Richard, first question coming to you and then Adrian something coming your way\\nas well. Can you give us push-pull factors for margins next year, this is coming from Kapil. You are currently\\nat 6.5%, guidance is 6% plus. How does this workout? Some color would be helpful.\\nRichard Molineux\\nYes, of course. So we're expecting volumes next year to be circa 400,000, so a little bit higher than our Q4\\nrun rate. On the positive side we're also expecting supplier inflation to start to reduce. Some of it will\\nbecome embedded in terms of their labor rates, some of it in terms of commodity rates and utility rates,\\nstarting to show signs of coming-off the peaks. On the other side, we, at the moment we have foreign\\nexchange rates that are slightly less favorable than we had during the course of Q4. And we will need to\\nstart investing in marketing to secure the order intake that we need towards the back end of the year.\\nFinally, I think the other negative is we do expect, I saw some questions on that later on, we do expect\\nVME to increase, but we expect that to be a creep rather than a leap. So we are not going to get into mass\\ndiscounting of cars for our cars, , we're a modern luxury player. We do expect VME to creep up. So I'd say,\\nFX, marketing and VME a little bit adverse. Volume and supplier inflation is a little bit favorable.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Richard. Adrian, there is a series of questions coming from Chandramouli of Goldman.\\nWe have guided to a 6% EBIT margin and GBP 2 billion cash flow this year. Last year we started in a similar\\nway at 5% EBIT and GBP1 billion FCF. What is giving you the confidence that this time around, things will\\nbe different, one. Second, order bank - also saw another question somewhere else, order bank at 200K,\\nand if you net out sales and arrive at - the number seems to be much lower in terms of new orders coming\\nin, need some color there. Second point. Third, a very interesting question on, what's behind the thinking\\nof the JLR rebranding? Is it just corporate action or there is something happening on the ground, which\\nwill -- which has triggered this stuff?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYes. Thanks, Balaji I'll take them in the order that they’ve been asked. Look for the last 12 months, we've\\nbeen optimistic about breaking through on supply. And the truth is for the first six months that we were\\ntoo optimistic. Our breakeven has been in place, it's been in place for more than 12 months, at the 300,000\\nunits. And simply put, we had to build more than 25,000 cars per month, of course. And we really didn't\\nget to that point to Q3 and you can see as soon as we have got to that point, which was a mixture of\\noverall supply with semiconductors and the MLA products, don't forget they're super crucial to our\\nbusiness model. They starting to come through in proportions we need from about November last year.\\nSo it’s those two things, which really moved us from a loss-making to a quite an aggressive and significant\\nprofit-making business. Breakeven still the same, we know the suppliers hire with new semiconductors -supply we secured from January. And we know our MLA production units, as Richard showed in the\\npresentation, they’ve grown to that 2,600 plus a week. So the two critical things we're waiting for\\nhappened in quarter three, continued at pace in quarter four. And we believe will continue now into FY'24,\\nwe can see it in the data we've seen in the first six weeks. So not only have we broken through but we can\\nsee the continuation of that, into the first half of this year and beyond. From an order bank perspective,\\nthe 200,000 units, look it's still too high. I think that's the first point we have to make here, right. We don't\\nhave an expectation and aspiration for200,000 units of orders, it’s two reasons. It's a symptom of supply\\nbeing too low and production being too low, and it's a symptom of the appeal for our vehicles that people\\nhave been prepared to wait for as long as they actually have. But the reality is a healthier order bank is a\\nlower order bank than 200,000 units. So my anticipation is, it will continue to fall by about 5,000 units per\\nmonth over the first half of this year. And to Richard's point, if that continues to happen and our supply\\nincreases as at that time we expect it to do so, and we will be stimulating further orders. But if you look\\nat any of our websites, particularly on the most sought-after vehicle the Range Rover, a lot of those order\\ntimes are now 12 to 18 months. We are not stimulating orders beyond 12 to 18 months at this point. To\\nthe proportional share point, which is in the question, 200,000 orders at the end of March, 76% of them\\nwere Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender. So it's still very skewed towards our three most\\nmodern, most luxurious nameplates today. And in terms of the brand question, the point there number\\nthree, now I'll reiterate what I actually said and was quoted within the media. Land Rover is the trust mark\\nfor three brands. And when you think about it the characteristics of those individual brands, Range Rover,\\nDefender, and Discovery, are different. And if we truly -- they're underpinned by the trust mark. So the\\noff -road capability, the versatility of the vehicle, the safety within the vehicle, the technologies are in all\\nof the brands. But if we're really going to grow our business in modern luxury, we absolutely have to focus\\non the distinct characterizations within those brands.\\nLook we know Range Rover is about luxury, quietness, serenity. We know Defender is about utility, go\\nanywhere. We know Discovery is about family size and the utility of being able to, in the broadest sense\\nuse this as a family traveller vehicle. We understand those things we have for a long time, but we have to\\ndeepen the understanding and the characteristics of vehicles because clients will be attracted to\\nindividually those brands, not just to Land Rover going forward. That's already clear in most of our biggest\\nmarkets China, USA, Middle East. So that's why we've actually elevated those sub-brands above the trust\\nmark to Land Rover, and that's what we're going to keep working through and working on going forward.\\nBack to you, Balaji.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Thanks, Adrian. This is coming from Jemma, J.P. Morgan. I think this question is picked up by\\nsomeone else as well, saying that, can we give color on the free cash flow guidance and the net debt\\nreduction for next year? How much of it is due to working capital and how much of it is due to underlying\\ncash flows? One kind of a question. Second kind of a question within that, you are increasing Capex to\\nGBP 3 billion but still guiding for debt going down to GBP1 billion. Richard, can you reconcile the two for\\nus?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nYeah. Sure. So we are going to increase our investment from GBP 2.35 billion this year to GBP 3 billion\\nnext year. Even considering that increase of GBP 650 million of investment, we are anticipating and expect\\nto generate beyond that GBP 2 billion worth of cash to take our net debt position, down from GBP3 billion\\nto GBP 1 billion. In terms of the proportion of that cash generation, that is operational and working capital,\\nwhat I'd say, certainly for the first half of the year, the majority of it will be operational. Working capital a\\nlittle bit more in the second half of the year. But if you, you only need to look at our cash flow generation\\nin the last six months, GBP1.3 billion, after about GBP1.3 billion worth of investment in the last six months.\\nSo we are a strong cash-generating business, when we're functioning at the type of levels that we're\\ntalking about. Adrian has mentioned several times our breakeven volume is around 300,000 units. I've\\nmentioned that next year we should be operating at 400,000 units, that's where we get our EBIT and cash\\nreturns from.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Thanks, Richard. One question, if Ben is there, do you intend to come to the bond market and\\nwill you do some sort of senior secured debt? The second, the latter part I can answer, clear answer no.\\nFirst part, Ben, over to you.\\nBen\\nSure. So I think that at some point we will come back to the bond market, we've been a regular issuer. But\\nI think we'll just keep monitoring the market for the right time. I think part of it is our financial\\nperformance is improving as we've talked about here today and potentially some benefit in continuing to\\nwait, we can pace we expect that to continue. But on the other hand, there are plenty of uncertainties in\\nterms of needing to go to the market. I don't think there is any need. As has been explained, we expect\\nsignificant positive cash flow in the year and that is after significant investment spending. So, we don’t\\nneed to fund investment spending. I think it would be more a matter of managing our liabilities.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Thanks, Ben. Question to Richard, and then another one - same thing to Shailesh and this is\\nfrom Rakesh, BNP Paribas.\\nJLRs investment of GBP15 billion, can you give us a rough idea of how much of that is going into R&D EV\\nproduct development, how much going into ICE?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nRichard Molyneux\\nYes. So look, this year our total engineering went up by GBP 400 million to GBP1.69 billion. I would expect\\nthat to continue to increase a little bit next year. However, the majority of the increase over the next\\ncouple of years is going to be in capital, as we industrialize all of our 2024, '25, '26 car lines into Solihull\\nwhich is where we will be producing Jaguar and where we are producing the Range Rover BEV, adding to\\nHalewood which is where we will be producing EMA. So in the short-term, it will be partly an increased\\nengineering, in the next 18 months - two years, capital will be the primary part of the increase. In terms\\nof EV and ICE, we are going to have to continue to invest in ICE to meet the Euro 7 regulations that came\\nthrough. However, obviously, the vast balance of our efforts is in the EV space as the majority of the\\nlaunches that we have post now are EVs.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Question to Shailesh. In terms of with the domestic PV market competition is obviously picking\\nup, especially with clear head-on competition to Nexon and Punch. Any ideas of how you are preparing\\nto defend your volume and market share?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYes. So see, we have seen in the past also and last year also we have seen that in SUV segments whenever\\nthere is a new model which gets launched typically the segment expands. And this expands because it is\\nchannelizing flow from existing segments into SUV segments. This has been at the cost of hatches going\\ndown or sedans going down. So, I think that phenomenon is going to continue despite. And Nexon\\nsegment, you have already seen that this segment has seen every year addition of new models and only\\nthe segment has expanded. And we as a company have been seeing increasing volumes of Nexon. Similar\\nthing in Punch, so this is one - volumes will get channelized from other existing segments to this, so the\\nsegment is going to expand. From our perspective we will keep the excitement in these two products high,\\nthrough several interventions, New Forever interventions we keep on bringing. Recently we got the #Dark,\\nPunch we came with CAMO, but also at the same time, let's take for example, punch, we are going to\\nbring CNG variant here with the twin cylinder technology and this is going to be unique in the market. We\\nare also planning to bring EVs, so we are very confident that these two products will be able to sustain\\nthe volumes. Of further actions, how we will further grow from where we are, and both in terms of volume\\nand market share, we are going to add new nameplates and we have showcased that in Auto expo, Curvv,\\nSierra, these are new nameplates, which are going to get launched. There's going to be a steep increase\\nin the EV volumes. We are expanding our portfolio in the CNG segment, so I think we have several levers,\\nwhich are going to increase our volumes, as well as market share.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Shailesh. Next is from Gunjan. I think the JLR side of the questions have all been answered. So let\\nme move to the PV side, I think that's also coming from Ashish later on as well. India PV, the volumes are\\nat 540K and at this level capacity utilization is extremely high, 65% SUV share. From here on what is there\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nfor the margin improvement drivers? And why do we, and why are the margins still not as strong as others\\nwho are there in the market and your plans for the same?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo one thing I would like to say that, last year, if you see the EBIT has increased by 300bps. So it is an\\nimproving trend and significantly improving trend, the whole benefit of operating leverage has been fully\\nrealized. The margins at a contribution level has been increasing. Of course, alongside we are also seeing\\na steep growth of EV business. There the margins I think, Balaji, very well explained that it is underlying\\nmargins are strong, but there is a huge product development expense which also gets charged-off. So it\\nwill have an impact. But there are plans in terms of how we are going to strengthen the margins for EVs.\\nAnd also, as you know, the battery prices had gone up significantly by 35%, the cell prices had gone up.\\nThere was huge semiconductor open market purchase, which was being done. All these are factors which\\nwe reclaim back. Battery prices are going down, semiconductor open market buys have come down. So\\nthese are all positive things which are going to favorably influence the contribution for EVs. Also there is\\na deep localization that we are doing, which is going to further bring down the cost. So there are a lot of\\nactions on the EV side, which is going to improve the margin, including, the new models, which we are\\ngoing to launch, is going to be in the SUV, higher SUV segments, which will be better in margin. I'm not\\ntalking even about PLI and all, because -- and we have a clear pathway to bring this to say, at a contribution\\nlevel into a double-digit margin closer to where we are in PV. And on top of that, of course, we are going\\nto have the PLI benefit and all.\\nOn the PV side, I think again, a richer mix is what we are expecting in the coming years, which is going to\\nstrongly support. There is an institutionalized cost reduction plan with a very aggressive plan that we are\\ntaking a benchmark and tearing down at a component level. So all these actions, I'm sure that we are\\ngoing to continue to improve on the margins.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks. I think there's another question, which Ashish had asked under those guidance for a 10% margin\\nin PV. Just to correct, that is the EBITDA margin we are referring to. That is what we want to reach. And\\nShailesh has already explained his drivers for the same. Question to both Shailesh and Girish, industry\\ngrowth both in India -- by India for CV and PV, given the demanding base is there, how do you want to?\\nDo you want to start with CV?\\nGirsh Wagh\\nYeah. Okay. So I think while the industry has grown pretty well in FY23 over the previous year, I think we\\nhave to keep in mind that the industry volumes are still below the previous peak of FY19, that's point\\nnumber one. Point number 2 is, I think generally in the pre-election year, that is the general election, year\\nbefore general elections, market has always grown, especially because of the government spending. And\\nI think this year in the budget, we are looking at almost record spending on infrastructure by the\\ngovernment. I think these are good tailwinds for the industry. And as a result, I think the industry should\\ngrow further during this year, although it may be in single-digits and growth may vary across the year, as\\nwell as across various segments. So, one would see highest growth happening probably in buses, because\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nthe buses still are at a lower level followed by a good growth in the medium and heavy commercials. It\\nappears that the ILCVs may remain flat compared with the last year and the small commercial vehicles\\nmay grow a bit. In terms of timing, it appears that the first quarter may degrow a bit Y-o-Y, because of\\nsome pre- buy effect and also the transition into the BS6 Phase II and the price increase, which has\\nhappened. But after that, one would see growth in Q2, Q3, as well as Q4. So I think that's how we see how\\nthe markets will grow. Overall, it appears that we will see a single-digit growth at the industry volume\\nlevel. Thanks.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo on the PV side, I would say that, we are very clear that the secular trend of growth of the industry is\\ngoing to remain intact, because of the underlying drivers that drive penetration levels. And also given that\\nnow the market is having a lot of upgrade customers. So people are wanting to upgrade the vehicles and\\nthat is the phenomenon that we have been seeing when it comes to SUV growth. And therefore going\\nforward, while there was a very steep growth of 27% in the last financial year, also, thanks to the pent-up\\ndemand and low inventory levels that we had at the start of FY23, I think that helped in driving this kind\\nof growth, which was 27%. Otherwise, which could have been much lower, I would say. So, therefore, this\\nyear would be, growth would be slightly moderate in the zone of 5% to 7%. But I'm sure that beyond this\\nfinancial year, the growth will come back to double-digit number, is what I'd say.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you, Shailesh. Question from Kapil on EV margins is already covered. I think there is a question of\\nPLI that is there in various places, where do we stand on PLI? Shailesh, could you pick that?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYes. So, as far as PLI is concerned, there have been a lot of engagement with the Ministry of heavy\\nindustries on this topic and discussions have revolved around the domestic value additions. And MHI has\\nbeen very receptive of the inputs from our side. There have been several inputs that have been given. And\\nof course, the requirement from the MHI to establish the extent of DVA that any OEM has attained was a\\nbit stringent which has been brought to a level which is now practical. And we are going to be working on\\nthat. And hopefully, the first model is what we are going to submit with the DVA status very soon. From\\nthere on, we'll probably secure the PLI eligibility for all our models. Most, all the models that we are selling\\ntoday as per our estimates, cross DVA requirement and going forward, we are very confident of availing\\nthe PLI benefit.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Shailesh. Two questions from Kapil saying, I think, Girish, coming your way, April volumes much\\nweaker than industry for Tata Motors, what's happening and when we expect growth to return? And\\ntrucking conditions, how is that trending and how are dealer inventories?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nGirish Wagh\\nRight. So, Kapil, first of all on the volumes, I think first point is, because it is aligned to the retail. I think\\nthe retail volumes in April have dropped after the pre-buy effect in the month of March. So as we said\\nthat we will align our production and offtake to retail, I think that is the first thing. Second, of course, as I\\nmentioned earlier, when we have transitioned to BS6 Phase II, I think there is a significant change, which\\nhas been done in the entire product portfolio. Every product in the portfolio, one has seen significant\\nimprovement in terms of power to weight ratio, total cost of ownership, comfort and convenience, safety\\nand as a result, there were some supply chain issues also in month of April, which will get addressed from\\nthis month of May. Finally, as I already answered, I think Q1, we see that there would be a de-growth in\\nretail registration volumes because of the pre-buy effect, but the growth will come back from Q2. As far\\nas trucking sentiment Index is concerned, for the tippers, it has gone up, which was expected. I think for\\nother segment, which is trucks, ILCVs, small commercial vehicles, they have dipped marginally. And that\\nwas also expected after a strong Q4. But as I said, I think, equation between headwinds and tailwinds, I\\nthink the tailwinds should prevail after some time and therefore, one would still see growth happening\\nfrom Q2. In terms of dealer inventories, I mean, very happy that the inventories continue to be healthy,\\nespecially after very good retail that happened in Q4. And we will continue at this level and because we\\nare matching retail, off take, production in that sequence, I think this will remain at good level.\\nBalaji, I will take the next question also.\\nPB Balaji\\nYeah, let me quickly cover that for people who are not seeing the question that you’re taking. This is on\\nthe entire EV buses, GCC model. Are EV buses viable without FAME subsidy, just a basic question. And will\\nyou participate in future MSRTC orders, given that you are not participated in the recent CESL tender?\\nGirish Wagh\\nOkay. So, let me take the first one. See, as far as the electric buses, bulk of those are being consumed\\ntoday by the government and most of those are now also being consumed in the own operate maintain\\nmodel, which is an Opex model and not a Capex model, right? So, even if the FAME subsidies are not\\nthere, finally, it will lead to some increase in the Opex that is the charge per kilometer and that will be\\npart of the bids that all the OEMs will give. And that will then get translated into the ticketing or the ticket\\nrates, which will be there. So I don't think this should have an impact especially on the gross cost contract\\nmodel. As far as private customers retail models are concerned, and the retail customers are concerned,\\nthere is an increasing interest, and because many of the corporates would also like to start moving\\ntowards their net-zero goal for greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, they would like to move or move\\ntowards electric buses for their employee transportation, so this should also continue.\\nAnd lastly, I think the 5,000 MSRTC order or any other order, I think let me once again clarify it. We did\\nstay away from the second tender of CESL because we had requested for a payment security mechanism\\nto the government and the government agencies, which didn’t get implemented in tender two and\\ntherefore we stayed away. A third tender was also released by CESL, in which there was only one player\\nwho bid, other - all other players didn’t bid, because this payment security mechanism wasn't there. And\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\ntherefore that tender will be re-bid. And we will continue to engage with the government to craft the\\npayment security mechanism, which will make the whole model bankable. Once that is done, I think we\\nwill be very much into this game. Balaji?\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Thank, Girish. Jinesh you've asked a series of questions, a lot of details. My suggestion, we will\\ntake it offline with you, so these numbers we can supply to you offline. So kindly pardon me, it's going to\\ntake a long time to go through all your questions here.\\nMoving onto Joseph, IIFL. This is an order flow conversation, which I think has already been covered and\\ntherefore similarly the working capital piece has also been covered. The additional new questions coming\\nup is activation of Sanand plant, will it bring in negative operating leverage, and how do you intend to deal\\nwith it?\\nIt's fair to say some cost is coming in without the revenue, but it's part of the long-term capacity planning.\\nTherefore it is part of the overall mix that we play with. So, our guidance for getting to that double-digit\\nEBITDA includes these stuff, but that's how volume is going to come. So I'm not concerned about that.\\nComing on to Ashish, I think this is on battery, with this new area let's talk about that. There are comments\\nin the media on the battery plants in India and EU, and you can give some color on this?\\nAll we can say at this point in time is conversations are underway, with both in India as well as in Europe.\\nAnd we intend to come to a conclusion sooner rather than later. And when we do that, we will take you\\nthrough it in greater detail, so you can understand everything related to that. Volume guidance, we don't\\ngive, I think everything we have to say, we already said so further guidance is we don't intend to give.\\nInitial talking about India FCF generation. Fair point, we have talked about JLR. India will also be positive\\nin free cash flows and it will be integral to one more contributor to the net debt reduction that we have\\nin mind, despite the Rs. 8,000 crore spend that we have on the Capex.\\nSecond, this is for Adrian coming your way from Stephanie, under house of brands, Jaguar intents to\\nlaunch of premium GT, given the recent price cuts that have come from competition, are you concerned\\nabout it?\\nAdrian Mardell\\nThere is work to do for sure. But we have really cleared the positioning of this brand going forward. We\\nannounced that the pricing of this will be more than 100,000 units, position as a very low breakeven point,\\nso work to do not concerned at this point now.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. The second one related different question is does JLR intend to reinstate the dividend if cash\\nflow exceed the expectations in FY24?\\nThe dividend policy has been approved by the Board for JLR and the Board at an appropriate time will take\\na look at it and it will be as per the dividend policy.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nMay 12, 2023\\n\\nNext question from Chirag. Volumes, Q1 as base volume and it keep rising, will it lead to some adverse\\nmix? And commodity benefits, are they likely to flow in? Richard, you want to take that? Then I'll come\\nto CV here?\\nRichard Molyneux\\nYeah. Sure. So on the 94,000 that we sold in Q4, I think I said, we expect the first half of the year to be\\nsort of around that type of level. Will it lead to some adverse mix? No, it won’t. We mentioned we have\\nan order bank of 200,000, 76% of those are Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Defender and those are\\nthe orders that will be fulfilling during that period, largely.\\nIn terms of commodity benefits, yes, we do expect, as I mentioned beforehand, some of the inflationary\\npressures at the suppliers start to come down. Commodity rates being part of that, utilities as well.\\nWhereas some of the inflationary impact on our suppliers, particularly in terms of their labor costs are\\ngoing to be embedded and will probably continue to grow. So there are some upsides and some\\ndownsides in terms of our supply cost, but we expect the rate that I showed you in terms of outbound\\ninflation exceeding inbound inflation to continue.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Richard. A question Girish your way and also there is a question below that has the same thing,\\ndiscount pull back in Q4. Was it driven by pre-buy or is it a new normal? And can you give a rough sense\\nof how much discount have you pulled-off?\\nGirish Wagh\\nSo, I think, the quantification of discount pullback, Balaji has already shown in his presentation, there was\\na clear reconciliation in the slide. Now coming to this discount pullback, I would rather like to say that it\\nis about customer value perception. So what we have been focusing on two, three things, one is\\ncontinuously increasing the customer value. And second is taking a lot of efforts in communicating that\\nvalue and ensuring that the customer experiences that values, so it would be a mix of communication\\nwhether it is ETL, influencer advocacy or in market trials. A lot of work has been done and we have been\\nconsistently increasing that customer value, basis which we are able to increase the market operating\\nprices. So it is, I would say a function of customer perceived value and that to how does the customer\\ncompare it with the competitive offers that he or she has. So I think our focus has been to continuously\\nimprove that. And I can say that, when we transitioned to BS6 Phase II, we have been able to do a step\\nchange because that opportunity was available during product development. Balaji?\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Thanks, Girish.\\nThere is a question on PV outlook, seems to have changed significantly in the quarter, I think Shailesh has\\nalready covered as to how we see the industry scenario going forward, so we stick to that.

As a reminder, all\\nparticipant lines will be in listen only mode and we will be taking questions via the teams platform, which\\nis already open for you to submit your questions. You are requested to mention your name and the name\\nof your organization while submitting the questions. I now hand over to Balaji to begin the presentation.\\n\\nPB Balaji:\\nThank you. Once again, thanks, everybody for taking the time to join the call. As is customary, let's run\\nthrough the deck at reasonable pace and thereafter spend as much time as possible on Q&A. So customary\\nSafe Harbor statement. Nothing to report here other than the normal one that is the segments. Again,\\ndraw your attention to the changes that we have done over the last one year. So that's up there.\\nNext slide, please. The quarter as such was a pretty intense quarter. And I draw your attention to the\\nAuto Expo, which I am sure Shailesh and Girish will quickly touch upon in their slides as well. A pretty\\nintense affair and an exciting presentation from Tata Motors across the whole theme of moving India and\\nsomething that has been very well received in the market as well. We also completed the acquisition of\\nthe Ford facility in Sanand, and we are getting into the integration of employees there. We also issued a\\ndrawdown notice for the tranche 2 of the Rs. 3,750 crores i.e. $500 million to TPG Rise and the funds are\\nexpected to be received by end of January. And JLR order book, which I am sure, and the semiconductor\\nsituation is something that Adrian is going to talk about.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nNext slide, please. Overall on the quarter, a very satisfying performance with a revenue of Rs. 88,500\\ncrores, EBITDA of 11.1% and the profit before tax and exceptional items of Rs. 3,200 crores, revenue\\ngrowth of 22.5% and an EBITDA improvement of 90 bps and EBIT improvement of 270 bps. The key call\\nout here is that after long time, all the three auto verticals are actually profitable and improving their\\nperformance and therefore that's driving the margin and FCF improvement that you see and we hope to\\nsustain that in the coming quarters as well.\\nNext slide please. The source of growth, a lot of it coming from volume and mix and of course pricing\\nstarting to come through as well as we start taking pricing above and the inflation starts stabilizing.\\nProfitability improvement coming across JLR, CV, PV, which is what I referred to earlier. And the only fly\\nin the ointment is the losses we have taken in Tata Motors finance something which I will talk about\\ntowards the end. Automotive debt came down to Rs. 57,500 crores. And the point that I am sure there's\\na question that's going to come. In the case of JLR, we do see a stretch in meeting the net debt zero\\ntargets. So we will update where we are on this in the end of March. Again confident in TML India as far\\nas that number is concerned, we should be able to get it to net zero there. So intention is to work on all\\nother areas as well.\\nNext slide please. So with this, let me hand it over to Adrian to take us through the presentation on JLR.\\nAdrian over to you.\\n\\nAdrian Mardell:\\nYeah. Thanks, Balaji. Next slide, if you would, please. Okay, so these are our KPIs for the quarter. Standard\\nformat you see versus last quarter and then the same quarter last year. Retails were slightly lower than\\nlast quarter. We'll get into the details of that a little bit later. We did improve significantly our deliveries\\nof MLA units Range Rover, Range Rover Sport. They principally get targeted to North America and to China.\\nNorth America was actually up 34% quarter-over-quarter and China was lower because of the COVID\\nshutdowns, is the punch-line. But you'll see that in more detail later. Revenue because of that\\nstrengthening mix and the overall increase in wholesales, wholesales did actually increase by 5.7% versus\\nlast quarter. Significant increase. Significant improvement. You can see there above the GBP 6 billion level\\nand we anticipate being above GBP 6 billion revenue for the foreseeable future. Of course, PBT was very\\nstrong, our breakeven points are still below 300,000 units annually, 75,000 units per quarter. In fact, they\\nwere down to 70,000 units in Q3. Half of that PBT number is actually a revaluation gain on conversion of\\nour dollar denominated debts mostly, and we'll get into that in later slides. EBITDA held up well 11.9%,\\nEBIT was particularly encouraging at 3.7%, significantly higher than the comparative periods. And cash,\\nonce we break through that breakeven point with our average transaction values and average GVR being\\nabove GBP70,000 per unit now. It really does escalate into a considerable cash positive GBP 490 million,\\nthe best cash quarter for seven quarters. Next slide, please.\\nOkay. So these are the key highlights. We'll get into some more of the details around these later. The\\norder banks did grow, we’ll explain our expectations on that going forward. Refocus did deliver again up\\nto GBP 850 million, which again, will repeat our confidence in more than GBP1 billion on that as well. And\\nvery importantly, our cash liquidity continues to be strong, GBP 3.9 billion. And we actually secured the\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nextension of our revolving credit facility at the end of December and then into early January, that got\\nextended to GBP 1.52 billion through to April 2026. Next slide, if you would, please.\\nSo, these are the quarter three highlights on retail and wholesale volumes. You see the big call out at the\\ntop there up marginally on wholesales 5.7% or 6%, 15% year-over-year. My focus on retails, first of all, as\\nI have mentioned, the actual retails did fall a little bit. This is by nameplate. Basically we've improved the\\ndeliveries on Defender and you will see increasingly going forward. And now we've moved to three shift\\non Defender. A lot of our orders on the Defender nameplate will start to fall and the retails increase.\\nRange Rover held up. But within there we're starting to improve our MLA deliveries, Range Rover and\\nRange Rover Sport, which is a fundamental improvement in this quarter's delivery. From a wholesale\\nperspective, there is steady improvement, 5% or 6% this quarter. Just a little bit more than the quarter\\nbefore. That's a progression we're starting to see now. The progression I think we can start to anticipate\\ngoing forward. Again, you can see that Defender delivery increasing in quarter three to almost 24,000\\nunits and the Range Rovers and Range Rover Sports coming through also as well.\\nNext slide, if you would, please. And this is by region really important. Say those bigger units are Range\\nRovers and Range Rover Sports. Now, we've doubled the volume of deliveries. They're starting to impact\\nNorth America heavily. You can see that both on the retail and the wholesale piece. And even though\\nthose units were made available within China, of course, the lockdowns in December, within the retailer\\nfacilities in China meant that they weren't in a position to take those deliveries. And so the reduction in\\nboth the China retail and wholesale was inventory we held ourselves pending pass over to China. The\\nactual uplift in China in the first three weeks of January is very strong. As those dealer outlets have opened,\\nof course, the dealers have an appetite to take those units, they're moving very, very quickly. And that\\nwill be our anticipation post New Year also. The electrified number of units have grown to 67%, but you\\ncan see we're in a frame of 65% to 70% now and that's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Next\\nslide, please\\n\\nOkay. So the bridge, the bridge versus the same profitability last year infact a small loss last year, EBIT\\n1.4%. So volume and mix is starting to influence this considerably. And that would be a shape we would\\nexpect to continue going forward. The pricing and VME is still very low and obviously it's corroboratory\\ndata around those units actually being passed over at very low levels, 0.6% VME and their targeted levels\\non targeted nameplates within targeted regions. Most of our larger units have zero VME at this point in\\ntime. We do, however, as we've talked before, some considerable headwinds on material cost inflation,\\ncommodity inflation, utility prices also, but they are starting to peter away. And also we've had to go into\\nthe marketplace to buy premium chips to keep supply going. So that's all a part of our material cost. Again,\\nwe're starting to see that taper down. And my expectation going forward is that pricing in VME will begin\\nto offset the material cost increases in quarter four and beyond. We are investing more. We're absolutely\\nspending more within our commercial areas, our commercial function. Both our marketing now, our\\nmarketing is still only two-thirds of the level it was pre-semiconductors, of course, so coming from a low\\nbase, but we will be actually starting to spend more fixed marketing as confidence on supply comes\\nthrough over the next weeks and months. And particularly our engineering spend to move towards our\\nreimagined electrified future is starting to increase pace. And we'll show you that in more detail when we\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nget to the capital slide. And the operational exchange is the big news is the revaluation I've mentioned of\\nour dollar denominated debt, you know, sterling appreciated from 1.12 to 1.20 in the quarter. You see\\nmostly that within the reval line, but our operational position is still ahead of our hedges that crystallized\\nwithin the quarter and therefore there's a net gain on operational fx and that adds up to the 3.7% EBIT,\\n265 million PBT. Encouraging quarter for us.\\nNext slide, please. So this is the cash that flows from that. You can see the GBP 265 million, I have just\\nreferenced. GBP 800 million cash profit after tax. Look, you know, our model works really well when that\\nnumber moves up towards 1 billion. That's where we were at the end of FY'21. That's where we expect to\\nget back to over the next few quarters. And that's why the underlying cash flow is still strong, even though\\ninvestment spending is starting to increase. Working capital was a nice rewind this quarter of GBP 306\\nmillion but it's only a small fraction of the adverses we've had on working capital since March 2021, GBP\\n1.77 billion negative from that point, most of that will rewind as we move through the several next\\nquarters. And what you're looking for here is production and wholesale volumes to grow through 30,000\\nunits a month, then 35,000, and when we get to 40,000 units a month, which is where we were at in\\nMarch 2021, most of that will actually rewind. So a lot of cash is going to come through from working\\ncapital as we build back our production volumes and our wholesale volumes. Of course, free cash flow\\nGBP 490 million best result for seven quarters, very pleasing on just 79,600 units.\\nNext slide, please. This is the break even slide. I won't dwell on it just to say we're still at the 280,000 level\\nin Q3. It will average out to around 300,000 full year. We are starting to invest more, including our fixed\\nmarketing and our commercial digital strategy, so our costs will increase, but with the mix strengthening\\non MLA and defender units, we do expect a containment of breakeven over the next two to three quarters\\nor so.\\nNext slide, please. This is the investment number I mentioned. It is worth referencing last year. Last year\\nhere I think. So, GBP 622 million in total, up just over 100 million. Pretty much all of that, infact more than\\nall of that is in the engineering spends. We are bringing more engineers, of course, into the organization\\nto deliver our Reimagine strategy, our electrified future. And that's starting to impact on our cost base as\\nit needs to do so. More of that is being capitalized now, 48%, which demonstrates the maturity of those\\narchitectures as starting to grow and improve. We were down at 26% only earlier in the year. So this is\\nactually a good sign. And I do expect investment to continue to increase beyond GBP 650 million towards\\nGBP 700 million over the next quarter or two.\\nNext slide, please. So our Reimagine electrified strategy. Look, there's no change to our electrified\\nstrategy. I know I'm on record in saying that. I thought I'd dwell here on the key highlights, which is exactly\\nthe same as previous highlights you would have seen from our electrified journey. MLA architecture is out\\nthere, the beautiful car you see there and it's Range Rover Sport, the order banks are being filled by those\\ntwo products. It is the epitome, we believe, of modern luxury, beautiful proportions to that vehicle and\\nthe Range Rover Sport, the minimalist luxury view inside the vehicle. That's a great signature to vehicles\\nand quality and view of vehicles we will put forward going forward. Within two years, we will have a full\\nelectrified Bev Range Rover. It's just two years away now, recognising our order bank support for that\\nproduct for the next 12 months or so, the gap between orders and new electrified vehicle is closing and\\nwill continue to close as we go through 2023.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nWe’ll then in 2025 come forward with our first all new electrified Jaguar products. And then beyond that,\\nour other Range Rover and other Defender products will come along in the next two years. So within two\\nyears, most of our vehicles will have full electrified offerings and that will be complete in all models before\\nthe end of the decade. We are estimating 60% of sales by then will be BEV. But the important point, we\\nwill have offerings across the range over that period of time. We still maintain zero tailpipe emissions by\\n2036, net zero carbon emissions by the end of that decade. So our electrified future continues at pace\\nand the investments we're now making are going to grow towards it over the next 12 to 18 months at\\nleast.\\nNext slide, please. Okay, so these are our wholesale volumes. You know, I think the important thing here,\\nyou can see the gradual improvement, but I like to look at quarter versus last year. So Q2 '23 versus Q2\\n'22. You can see there about a 15% increase. We know Q3, there's a 15% increase and that starts to give\\nyou an indication of what we should begin to expect in quarter four. So we are expecting that number to\\ngrow in Q4 and obviously to continue to grow going forward. So we do think we've made a lot of progress\\non supply, particularly on semiconductors, particularly for this calendar year. But there are still challenges\\nof course. COVID in China is a challenge and we'll talk about that in a few moments. But we are improving,\\nour break even points are stabilizing, and therefore our profitability, EBIT, revenue and cash will be\\ngrowing as we go forward.\\nNext slide. Okay, Range Rover and Range Rover Sport. The MLA architecture are fundamental to the\\ndelivery of our business model and our business success and we explained in great detail over the early\\nquarters of last year how it was difficult for us to gain the parts to grow, to grow the volumes. We've broke\\nthrough that in September. You can see the average weekly is growing quarter-over-quarter. We will\\ndeliver more production units in Q4. It won't be that same size of scale of increase, but it will be a sizeable\\n10%, 15% improvement in Q4 over Q3. Also, we can maintain our 33% to 35% worth of deliveries on these\\nproducts, and that will maintain our average selling price at the levels you've just seen, while it's a strong\\nvariable profit mix portfolio going forward. This really is now starting to show through our business results,\\nparticularly in Q3 and going forward.\\nNext slide, please. Okay, so what's going to happen to order banks? Well, first point is they did continue\\nto grow in quarter three and we've helpfully here broke out the amount of deliveries we passed over to\\ncustomers, 85,000 versus the amount of new orders, 95,000. So, you know, at this level of marketing\\nspend and we are only spending two-thirds of the level on marketing we were before semiconductor\\nshortages. But at this level you can expect new orders to grow by 30,000 or thereabouts a month. But our\\nfulfilled orders, our retails will start to grow now, we're already seeing that in Q4 in part because of the\\nopening up of China, but I do anticipate in quarter four fulfilled orders to be above new orders and\\ntherefore our order banks to start to taper down towards a level which is more natural maybe towards a\\n200,000 level over the next three to four months. Most of them, as we've said before, and those three\\nnameplates, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender, we have gone to third shift on Defender. And\\ntherefore as we come out of quarter four deliveries in particular and our fulfilled orders on Defender will\\ngrow. And then we've also mentioned we expect to build another 10% or 15% more of the other two also.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nSo very confident our retail levels or our fulfilled orders are going to move towards 100,000 level over the\\ncourse of the next months and quarters.\\nNext slide, please. This is a super important slide. We dwelled on it several times, let me remind you, the\\ntop piece is a range of retail inventory targets and that dark blue line is now creeping towards the bottom\\nof that band, which means the vehicles are in the right place and that will trigger incremental retails in\\nQ4, as I've mentioned a couple of times. Our own wholesale stock, inventory we own, the band there you\\nsee below between 30,000 and 45,000 units. We're still within that band towards the bottom of it, but if\\nyou add those two numbers together, 82,000, inventory end to end finished vehicles at the end of\\nDecember, that was the highest number we had in inventory for several quarters back to around May\\n2021. So that's a good, healthy sign that we're starting slowly to fill the pipeline, which will trigger more\\nretailers etc, etc. So this really is starting to improve for us, although there are still issues we can get on a\\ndaily basis in terms of supply. Next slide, please. Inflation has been a theme all year. What did we say at\\nthe start of the year? We said refocus would offset inflationary claims. Nine months through this period,\\ninflationary claims have been GBP 660 million, Refocus has been GBP 850 million, half of which is in the\\ncommercial space. So we're doing what we said we would do, the investment number because we\\nmentioned earlier, we are accelerating and bringing more engineers in by future won't be the savings\\ngoing forward and our expectation is the commercial performance, the market performance will actually\\nthen begin to offset inflation in Q4 and beyond together with our efficiencies through our Agile\\ntransformation activities, which we've referenced previously also. So we are doing and we will do this year\\nexactly what we said we could do in terms of offsetting those high inflationary claims.\\nNext slide, please. You need to mention COVID and China we've all seen the reports and the extent of the\\ncontagion within the Chinese population. Q3 was impacted, of course by lockdowns particularly at the\\ndealers and also some disturbance in terms of the units we could build. Employee absence for a short\\nperiod was high. I'm really pleased to say that more than 90% of our employees at the production facilities\\nand 99% of our employees within our national sales company have now returned to work. And the\\nretailers definitely opened up for the three weeks in January. Obviously, we’re at Chinese New Year,\\nthere's a care point around what happens to the population following that, but we do anticipate, given\\nthe scale of contagion in the December period that we will get back to business very quickly in China at\\nthe back end of Q4. There is a care point around production facilities in China, supplier production facilities\\nthat we are monitoring. We’ll bring information back around that as we close out the years results, but it\\nis possible for us to be stopped within the UK production and within Nitra production and within China\\nproduction as a result of those supplier facilities, they won't be the scale and the size of the stoppages\\nwe've seen previously. We don't believe.\\nNext slide please. Outlook year-to-date I haven’t dwelled on Q3 here, but this is the summary so far yearto-date. I won't read it out apart from to say, we are now EBIT margin positive across the first nine months.\\nInvestment is lower, but growing. Free Cash Flow is just under GBP 300 million. I've shown there hopefully,\\nhelpfully what our expectation is for Q4, above 80,000 units on wholesale maybe closer to 85,000 plus, if\\nwe continue as we have in the first month. Revenue will exceed GBP 5 billion, closer to GBP 6 billion again.\\nWe will be positive on EBIT with that, our investment will grow probably around GBP 700 million, GBP\\n600 something and our free cash flow, we believe with those physicals will be more than GBP 400 million\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\npositive, which will make us positive free cash for the full year and the rest of the data, you see there.\\nWhat are our priorities, obviously continue to secure chip supplies moving through the strategic tie-ups.\\nBut due to the excellence of the work of the teams now, we really do have excellent teams in place now,\\nwe keep our supply and our lines going. Continue Range Rover, Range Rover Sport ramp up. I've\\nmentioned our expectation that will grow by 10% to 15% in Q4 over Q3. Improve on the 80,000 units we\\nhave done in quarter three within quarter four now. Refocus complete including more of those price\\nincreases coming through as we deliver more cars to customers. And obviously you know our job is to\\ndeliver positive data. So EBIT margin, and free cash flow in quarter four and also for the full year. Think\\nthat's my last slide.\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you, Adrian. Let's quickly move on to the Tata Commercial Vehicle space. Girish and I will take the\\nsession. As if you recollect, we had signalled this earlier saying that we will be focusing squarely on vahan\\nmarket share, registration market shares and shifting to a demand pull business model. That did cost a bit\\nof grief in the month of October, but since then we've been sequentially improving our market shares as\\nthe propositions are starting to land and we're starting to see this in across the rest of all the portfolio as\\nwell. Next slide, please. From the point I would like to call out here, just take a look at the CNG, the light\\ngreen bar there, substantial drop in CNG composition as the prices of CNG started inching closer towards\\nthe diesel and we should expect to see this trend reverse once the CNG prices start stabilizing and going\\ndown. So we are very much invested in CNG, but this is the current way it's played out. And the other\\nthing that we'll call out here is the whole international business where you would notice that the\\nwholesales have been pretty anemic as a challenge in the international business continues. Next slide\\nplease. From a financial performance standpoint, the demand pull model is translating into improved\\nprofitability of almost 580 bps. Revenue growth, of course, at 22.5% pretty strong and EBIT now at 5.9%,\\nup 650 bps.\\nNext slide, please. Drivers of this particular profitability, you would see draw your attention to the\\nrealizations adjusted against variable cost. You'll notice this number used to be negative in the past, now\\nsitting at almost +480 bps as the strategy starts playing out. And what you do see as the certain cost\\ndisadvantages that have come through this quarter, some of it, most of it related to the investment that\\nwe are making in the new technologies and hence is translating into higher employee costs. And then of\\ncourse, investing in the business as they are moving more and more money into FMEs, that's showing the\\nnumber there. Next slide, please.\\nLet me give it to Girish to talk about the business highlights\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nGirish Wagh\\nGreat. Thanks, Balaji. So the industry grew by around 16% over Q3 FY22. When I see the growth rates\\nhave been dropping now, but this is also due to the base effect. And that's what we will see in Q4 also,\\nthe growth rate will go down further. For Tata Motors, since we have been focusing on retail, setting our\\nretails were ahead of wholesales by 6% in the quarter gone by. And this is also in line with our preparation\\nto unwind as we gear up for the RDE transition in the month of April. I think good thing for industry, the\\ncommodity prices did soften in Q3 and that's how it is remaining in Q4 also as of now. And we are keeping\\na track of how the steel prices especially moves, steel prices and precious metals move in Q1 of next year.\\nBalaji spoke about the CNG. So I think with the CNG benefit going down and more so it is the concern in\\nthe minds of the customers about variability in CNG price. I think the volumes have come down and in\\nSCV they've come down to around 12% of the portfolio, ILCV we have come down to around 14% of the\\nportfolio and you would recollect in ILCV it used to be almost around 40%. Within the segments, I think\\nmedium and heavy commercial vehicles have seen a very good growth, almost 50% growth over Q3 of\\nlast year, again due to the base effect and even higher growth in the passenger segment. The passenger\\nsegment is back, I think it was the worst suffering one during the COVID period and during the COVID\\nrecovery. For us the non-vehicle business is spare parts, I think continues to do pretty well. Spare parts\\nand consumables, and in fact in the nine months in this financial year, we have grown by around 38% over\\nlast year and the penetration also keeps on increasing. So the share of the overall market is continuously\\nimproving quarter-over-quarter. On the product front, we continue to launch new products. And for the\\nyear, we've launched more than 40 new products as well as 150 plus variants. And this includes the Ace\\nElectric vehicle, for which we've already started the deliveries in the beginning of this month. The new\\nrange of pickups both Intra and Yodha I think has a very, very good traction in the market. And also good\\npremium that we are able to charge this equation. And we have also brought the CNG trucks which have\\nstarted seeing some traction. Coming to Auto Expo, we did introduce a comprehensive range and I am\\ngoing to speak about that a little later.\\nGoing ahead, we will continue to have the focus on these three things, which is retail pull, improving the\\nVahan share, which is the registration. And of course, by doing all this, I think realization improvement\\nagenda will continue. To push this agenda, we continue to engage with all the key stakeholders in the\\necosystem, be it customers and financiers more so and trying to get them on board. I think we see a very\\ngood commitment from all the stakeholders to the revised way of working or the revised operating model\\nthat we have put in place. RDE transition is what we are preparing towards. Migration will happen from\\nApril 2023. And of course as we did in BS6 in April 2020, even now I think we will come up with a lot of\\nvalue enhancement for the customer. So it won't be a plain, simple price increase. With the COVID\\nsituation globally, we did bring semiconductor supply situation back on our radar. Well, it was a bit\\nworrisome 15 days back, I think, in a fortnight, things have improved, but we will continue to keep this as\\nwell as the electric vehicle aggregates on our radar. In international markets, I think, in most of the\\nmarkets, the volumes have dipped significantly more than 50%. And in this kind of an environment, we\\nare focusing on maintaining our market shares in all the markets. Margins, selling margins have also been\\ndoing well. And, also the channel health, we are ensuring the channel health even at the lower volume,\\nwhich is extremely important when the volumes start ticking up.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nNext slide. Talking about Electric Mobility, so as I said I think we completed very successful trials of the\\nAce Electric Vehicle in our customers' operations. Both we started with e-commerce players, but we also\\nhad the FMCG players joining the bandwagon as also parcel and courier companies. And I think the\\nproduct has done very, very well, which is leading to even more inquiries for the product. I think we've\\nstarted these deliveries and as you can see in the third bullet, we have also now started pulling material\\nfrom the supply chain although we had a COVID scare, I think we will start ramping up the production of\\nthis vehicle. We did showcase almost eight zero emission concepts in Auto Expo, which I'll speak about.\\nOn our Smart City Mobility Solutions business that we have put in place, we signed a definitive agreement\\nnow with Delhi Transport Corporation as well as Bangalore for 1500 and 921 buses respectively, so that's\\naround 2421. In addition, we also got an order of 200 buses from Jammu & Srinagar. Our e-bus fleet now\\nhas cumulatively crossed more than 6 crore i.e. 60 million kilometers with more than 95% uptime till\\nDecember. The revenue generated by this business in the nine months has been Rs. 260 crores and at this\\nlevel of revenue I think the business is giving good profits. On the digital businesses, I think we continue\\nto grow the fleet age penetration. Our connected truck platform with the total vehicles crossing 337,000,\\nwhich is around 135,000 customers. And the usage also has been growing consistently, we have now\\nalmost 80% customers having active usage on the fleet age. E-Dukaan, which is our online marketplace,\\nwe used to sell spare parts for this. Now we have also added consumables like diesel exhaust fluid and\\nlubricant. And in addition to that, I think, we've also started adding some of our retailers as well as\\nmechanics as customers, so they can also order on this platform, and we see a very healthy growth almost\\n165% growth over the previous year. I spoke about digital lead generation during the last quarter. And we\\ncontinue to push this agenda. In the entire portfolio, we had almost 16% of our sales coming from leads\\ngenerated through digital means. We still have a good headroom because the convergence can improve\\nfurther from the level that we have reached.\\nNext. So talking about Auto Expo, I think the whole Auto Expo was making a statement of our journey\\ntowards net zero greenhouse gas emissions. So we committed by 2045, we will be net zero greenhouse\\ngas emissions. And, as our commitment towards that we demonstrated 14 concepts. We had hydrogen\\npropulsion in terms of Hydrogen ICE powered tractor, Hydrogen fuel cell tractor and also Hydrogen fuel\\ncell bus which actually will see commercial application from the next quarter. So this is to meet the IOCL\\norder that we had received last year. We also unveiled five electric vehicle concepts Ace of course the\\ndeliveries have started, the Starbus EV which is already on the road, the Ultra E.9 which is the next vehicle\\nwe see having good customer interest, Magic EV which is for the last-mile intracity passenger\\ntransportation and Prima 28 tonne tipper which is a good option to decarbonize the closed-loop usage of\\ntippers especially in mining. We also introduced two new fuel agnostic architectures, which addresses our\\nentire range from 7 tonnes to 55 tonnes and these two architectures can take any powertrain. So ICE as\\nwell as electric, in electric, battery electric, and then Hydrogen fuel cell electric as well as H2Ice. We of\\ncourse revealed Yodha CNG and Intra Bi-Fuel, which are available for sale now, commercial sale. Prima\\nLNG Tipper, which is also ready for commercial sale and we are working with few customers and of course\\npremium version of our Winger. In addition to this, we also had good interactive exhibits to explain our\\nfleet edge, the connected truck platform, the Sampoorna Seva, which is our bouquet of services as also EDukaan, which also attracted good attention. I think this was a very holistic display of not just our\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Thanks, Girish.\\nNext slide please. Moving on to passenger vehicles. Here the call out is the consistent improvement in\\nmarket shares and a strong growth, market beating growth that continues here. And the third call out is\\nCNG plus EV is now almost 17% of the portfolio. That will improve further once the new CNG launches\\ncome in as well as Tiago EV launches as well.\\nEV continues to be on a roll, we have surpassed the milestone of selling 50,000 EV vehicles from the start.\\nNext slide. From a performance perspective, 37% revenue growth, Rs. 300 crores almost of the profits,\\nEBITDA of 6.9%, albeit there's a one-offs of about 80 odd bps that you see in the EBITDA there, but EBIT\\nof about 1.5%. So strong performance continues in the profitability side, we should continue to see a\\nsteady improvement on this one.\\nNext slide. In terms of drivers, here again, you see the realizations and variable cost is now starting to\\nimprove further. So the underlying contribution margin of the business is starting to improve. And\\ninvestments fundamentally in the EV business with employees, building up the team that is what you see\\nout there as well as investments in products is what you see on the D&A side. Those are the two things\\nthat brought down the fixed cost line. Next slide, please. Let me hand over to Shailesh to give you a sense\\nof the business.\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nThank you, Balaji. Let me start with the key highlights of the industry. Quarter three was a retail heavy\\nquarter, I would say, and the industry reached its highest ever quarter - highest ever retails in its history\\nof more than 10.58 lakhs. And wholesales also grew by 23% as compared to the quarter three of last\\nfinancial year. EV industry has continued to show strong growth year-on-year versus last quarter (130%\\ngrowth), primarily led by Tata Motors. It is notable to see in the last calendar year, which was 2022, the\\nindustry wholesale was at its highest level at 3.8 million as compared to somewhere around 2019 where\\nit was at 3.3 million - 3.4 million level. So steep jump, I would say, nearly 25% growth as compared to\\nwhere we were in 2021. As far as Tata Motors is concerned, we have been around 14% market share\\nconsistently throughout the financial year. PV, EV business has delivered an industry beating growth of\\n33% for PV and a very high growth for the EV also. Like the industry, we also had the highest ever quarterly\\nretail at 139,000. For the calendar year 2022, we were the third OEM to cross the five lakh mark. And we\\nalso, as Balaji mentioned that during the last quarter, we crossed the 50,000 milestone for EVs since its\\ninception and in the last calendar year –I would just correct what number Balaji had given - it was actually\\n44,000, nearly 44,000 sales that we did for EVs in the last calendar year. We maintained our number one\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nSUV position as of year-to-date, and Nexon and Punch are among the top three in the 40 plus odd SUVs\\nthat we have in the market. As far as EV sales year-to-date is concerned, for the financial year, it is at\\n32.4K units with a market share of 85%.\\nGoing forward, the bright spots, given that the inventory in the channel is lean, there are new product\\nlaunches that we have seen recently in the industry and improved supplies, quarter four should be strong\\nas far as wholesale is concerned and as compared to quarter three. And as far as EV growth is concerned,\\nthere are a lot of states who have announced progressive EV policies and that should support the EV\\ngrowth in quarter four. As far as Tata Motors is concerned, the Tiago EV deliveries have commenced and\\nthis month we have a strong order book. We had extended the introductory pricing for the first 20,000\\ncustomers, which we have already crossed in terms of bookings. We, in the Auto Expo have showcased\\nthe Harrier & Safari Red # Dark, and this is going to be launched in this quarter itself. As far as BSVI phase\\ntwo transition is concerned, it is on track and ahead of the deadline. We, on 10th January completed the\\nacquisition of Ford plant in Sanand and we saw very strong response to the product unveils at the Auto\\nExpo which I will talk about in the next slide. Going forward as far as challenges are concerned, I think\\nafter a long duration of supply driven industry, now we are in a situation where supply has completely\\nnormalized. It is meeting the demand for all the regular models except for some popular models which\\nare still high on waiting list. Overall enquiry to the retail time has increased for the industry. You see, this\\nis a signal of lack of urgency among the customer with improve supplies, and price increase post BSVI\\nPhase 2 - we will have to see if there is any impact on the demand, something to be watched out for. In\\nterms of actions, we are willing to go for very focused demand generation initiatives specifically in certain\\nsegments as well as hyper markets. And as far as margin is concerned, we are taking structural material\\ncost reduction actions and we'll continue to drive other levers of margin improvement.\\nNext slide. Giving a quick overview of what did we showcase in the Auto Expo. The theme for this Auto\\nExpo was Moving India forward to safer, smarter and greener vehicles. And we had about 12 showcases\\nboth on EV as well as ICE side. We showcased the Tiago EV, which we already launched. Harrier EV was\\nalso showcased. This is a generation two product for us. Sierra EV scheduled to be launch in 2025 was also\\nshowcased. And Avinya, which is the generation three pure EV also slated to be launched by the end of\\n2025. These are the four products that we showcased. On the ICE portfolio side, I've already talked about\\nthe Harrier & Safari #Dark, which will come with ADAS as well as the bigger infotainment screen. This gets\\nlaunched in this quarter as I said. It was a big disruption that we have showcased in the Auto Expo, which\\nis CNG twin cylinder technology. I think this segment has always suffered with the handicap of having no\\nboot space because it was occupied by the cylinder and we came with this very innovative idea of having\\nthis twin cylinder which releases the space and retains in a way the boot space, which was otherwise being\\nsacrificed. This would come in the first half of next financial year. Then we also showcased the ICE version\\nof Curvv. If you remember in April 2022, we had showcase the EV version and along with this product we\\nhave also showcased the two TGDi engines in gasoline 1.2 and 1.5 liter, which will help us in coming with\\nproducts which will be greater than 4 meter in the ICE space. So this was received very well. This is what\\nI wanted to share. Back to Balaji.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Overall CV, PV cash flows - would draw attention to cash profit\\nafter tax - strong and therefore more than adequately funding the capex that we have and we gradually\\nclaw back the working capital that we lost in the first quarter, so that's what is happening.\\nNext slide please. Investments, you can read for yourself skipping this slide, but just to guide that for the\\nfull year, the investment spending is likely to be around Rs. 6,000 crores number - no change on that one.\\nNext slide please. Tata Motors Finance- and I want to take a few minutes on this because this is a\\ndisappointment for us this quarter where the GNPA increase that we saw in this portfolio – there are 2\\nreasons. Number one, the restructured book that is actually starting to perform pretty poorly and it's\\ncontinuing to do bad and going from bad to worse and as well as a onetime upgradation - one time hit\\nbecause of the RBI upgradation norms that we had. So, therefore we have started to get further provisions\\nput through in the restructured book. This is now almost 9% of the AUM of Rs. 41,000 crores, that we\\nhave and there are lot of efforts underway as you would expect to normalize the static restructured book\\nand therefore this work is going to be pretty intense in this quarter as well. The early results are\\nencouraging and the GNPA is starting to reduce November, December and January so far has been\\ntrending well - where the maturity efficiencies improving to 102%. The normal book is quite comfortable.\\nWe don't see stress there and capital adequacy also is quite comfortable there. But clearly this is an area\\nwhere we need to drive a lot of efforts to ensure that we get our collection efforts particularly on the\\nrestructured book.\\nNext slide please. Overall therefore our priorities you can read for yourself, but maybe the only thing I\\nwould like to highlight is the view on demand which I'm sure a lot of you are asking as well. We remain\\ncautiously optimistic both in JLR as well as India and there are enough global uncertainty that we are all\\naware of, but we still remain optimistic and we can't be complacent and hence the work both in JLR and\\nin India on the innovation intensity as well as activating the market and ensuring that we win our rightful\\nplace here. And of course, chip supplies are likely to improve further and therefore volumes will continue\\nto ramp up steadily, particularly in JLR and commodity prices, we do expect stability and therefore the\\nfocus on profitable growth should deliver a strong EBIT and free cash flows in Q4 as well. So that's what I\\nhave to say. The individual priorities by businesses, we have already covered. So let me not go through\\nthat. Let me start covering the questions that have come through already. We move to the question\\nsection.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nQuestions and Answers session\\nOkay. So maybe let's start with I think Ben this is coming your way, Ben or Adrian, either of you can take\\nit. Could you let us know the terms of the extension of the revolver? How much was undrawn and drawn\\nInterest rates increased by? And additionally given the cash cushion the company enjoys, is there a scope\\nfor optimizing the revolver debt balance further? And there's another question in terms of also about how\\nmuch of a repayment are you planning given the cash position there? But you want to just wrap this all\\nup with one response Ben\\n\\nBennet Birgbauer\\nYeah, I can cover that, Balaji. So broadly the terms of the revolver are in terms of covenants and things\\nlike that. The documentation is pretty much identical to the prior revolver, the pricing margin did go up\\n50 basis points to 3.35%, but that's on a drawn basis and on an undrawn basis all we do is we pay 35% of\\nthe margin. So the annualized cost of GBP1.5 billion revolver is about GBP18 million. So it's from our\\nperspective, it's the cheapest fire insurance you can possibly have. In terms of is there scope for optimizing\\nthe revolver debt balance. Well just because I think it is low cost liquidity insurance and we actually used\\nto have a higher revolver than that I don't really think we're considering taking down the revolver, we\\nobviously have the net debt target that we're still working towards. But I don't really see changing the size\\nof the revolver at this point.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you, Ben. Next question I think is from Chandramouli, Goldman Sachs. I think, Adrian, this is coming\\nyour way. On JLR how are we thinking about the demand outlook once we clear out our strong order\\nbacklog. If the current hawkish interest rate environment were to continue into the next year, what is\\nyour view on the demand and the next I think the same question coming into Girish later on. You take the\\nfirst one, Adrian.\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYeah. Thanks, Balaji. So from our perspective. Look our order banks are at historical highest compared to\\npre-supply challenges, they are double the level and you've seen the size of the increases over reduction.\\nSo we believe our order banks are going to stay unnaturally high particularly on the Range Rover where\\nwe’re sold out for more than 12 months now. We're not taking new orders until 24 model year and on\\nthe Range Rover Sport. Although we are rectifying Defender. So we will see a marginal reduction quarteron-quarter, but I still believe we will be this time next year talking about order banks, which are higher\\nthan ideal. So at today's level of known uncertainty in the marketplace on recession and interest rates at\\nthe levels we see in front of us going forward today I believe the challenge here continues through 2023\\nto be supply rather than demand. We have plenty of opportunity to increase demand and stimulate that\\ngiven we're only spending two-thirds of the level on fixed marketing we were 12 months, 18 months ago\\nor so.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Adrian. Girish this is coming your way. Same from Chandramouli itself. On India CVs, how are we\\nthinking about price hikes heading into the stricter emission standards beginning FY 24. Is it going to be\\nall at once or more phased in nature?\\nGirish Wagh\\nSo the cost increases for RDE are going to be lesser as compared to what we had seen in BSVI Phase 1.\\nBut even in this BSVI Phase 1, I think, we had taken all the increases or the price increase at one go. I think\\nthere is only one another factor that we have to keep a watch on which is the commodity increases, which\\nmay happen again in Q1 of next financial year. And basis both these things put together, we'll see what is\\nthe kind of price increase which has to be passed on. But from the point of view of RDE, I think it will also\\nvary model to model, but mostly it be passed out in one go.\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nJust sticking to you. This is from Sonal Gupta, HSBC MF. LCVs, while MHCV segment is showing strong\\ngrowth, LCV segment is showing a decline. Can you highlight the reasons?\\n\\nGirish Wagh\\nYes. So I think it is more of ILCV which is showing a decline, which in our parlances is 7 to 15 tons or now\\nit has gone upto 7 to 18 tons. So as you rightly pointed out, M&HCV is growing because of higher freight\\navailability. I think this year, we see that the freight supply is actually more than the trucks, which are\\nbeing put into the market and therefore fleet utilization is going up. As far as ILCV is concerned, one of\\nthe thing which is playing out is the base effect, right. So the decline, which had happened in ILCV was\\nmuch lower than that of MHCV, number one. And number two, we also see that in ILCV one had seen a\\nsignificant penetration of CNG where to some extent the diesel vehicles were also underutilized when the\\nlarge portion of CNG got pushed in or bought in more so. And I think those are coming back for usage\\nnow. So it is more of a base effect. And we do expect that this year while the MHCVs may grow above\\n45% on a year-on-year basis for the entire year, ILCV may end up growing only 14% to 15%. I don't know\\nwhether in LCV you are also referring to the small vehicles. So let me talk about that also. As far as small\\nvehicles are concerned, even here, I think it is the base effect which is coming in, but this continues to\\ngrow. The growth rate is tapering quarter-over-quarter, but still I think it appears that for the entire fiscal\\nwe should see a growth rate of more than 20%.\\nPB Balaji\\nYeah, thank you. Adrian, this is coming your way. This is from Jinesh Gandhi. In terms of JLR, you talked\\nabout higher inflation and supplier claims largely related to constrained volumes, can you talk about the\\nquantum of these two? Till what production level would you have to compensate vendors and the related\\nquestion - is chip related cost inflation expected to start moderating in CY 2023 as supplies improve. Is\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nthat a fair assessment. And you also talked about increased SG&A spend. What are the targeted levels to\\nwhich you want to increase SG&A spend. So maybe three distinct questions there.\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYeah, okay. So let me talk them in order of they were asked. So look the inflation claims and the reason\\nfor supplier claims. There is multiple reasons below that and in terms of the level that we expect to be\\nnormal. If you go back to FY 21 on previous calls, I've referred to FY 21 a lot before supply constraints. A\\nnormal level for us, we still believe will be the 120,000 units plus a quarter, 40,000 plus a month, 500,000\\na year. And once we get towards that level will be clear around much more we can push it beyond that.\\nSo for a normal environment and our suppliers are set up for normal environment. We would need to\\nbuild wholesale 40,000 plus units a month, and we're just above 26,000, 27,000 at the moment. So there's\\na long way from today to normal, but we do believe that increasingly quarter-over-quarter we will in\\ncalendar year 2023 move towards that normal level until we get 40,000 to that level, a number of the\\nreasons for the claims in particular the utilization of supplier factories which are within this number will\\nstill be there. Once we get to that level, if we have no unnatural requirement to go buy parts outside of\\nnormal channels that's eliminated then again we will eliminate another course called premium parts or\\nchip supply from the vendors, the brokers that will be eliminated as well. However, we will still be left\\nwith commodity prices at the moment, they are looking to be heading more aggressive against us and\\nthey will still be there and a lot of our contracts with suppliers have a pass-through on commodity costs.\\nSo there will be some level, that's the only problem we have. We probably won't be talking about it by\\nthe way, but it's wrapped up within that 200 plus million a month, including some more on utility is lower\\nthan it was and including the wage demands, which hopefully will come down with the interest rate\\npressures that are going to be put out. From an SG&A perspective, we will increase spend, but revenue\\nwill increase as well. So think about SG&A increasing commensurate with improvements in revenue. It's\\njust about 9% of revenue today, maybe a shade over think about that being a broad guideline going\\nforward on SG&A. So we won't be spending above our entitlement to spend, but as revenue grows, we'll\\nneed to stimulate some of that demand both of those datasets would increase.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Next question comes from Rakesh Kumar. Adrian, back to you again. Well PHEV incentives\\ncoming down in Europe, do you see risk to JLRs compliance with CAFE targets? Given the JLR's FCF\\ngeneration in third quarter and seasonally strong fourth quarter, is your FCF breakeven outlook for FY 23\\nconservative? And I'll separately pick up the Tata's battery manufacturing plants in Europe.\\n\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYeah, okay. So if I take the PHEV one before. Look, we've been very consistent on PHEV volumes over the\\nlast several quarters, around 11%. We obviously monitor this really carefully. When I look at the order\\nbank that we've referenced, the PHEV orders in that order bank are actually slightly richer than that at\\nthe moment, so up to 14%. So there is no indication at this point in time that any customer incentive\\nchanges on PHEV is having a sizable impact on the orders that we actually are receiving. Nothing at this\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\npoint in time. So I'd say what we see today. No to the first one. There is no impact on PHEVs. We don't\\nexpect it to be non-compliant in Europe over this next phase either. The strong JLR cash flow in the third\\nquarter - I think if we go back to the page that we talked to earlier, we are expecting a strong cash flow in\\nquarter four. The underlying cash should be broadly at the level that we saw in Q3 maybe around the GBP\\n200 million. I'm hopeful cash from operations will increase a bit with the increased volume. Our\\ninvestments are going to increase as well as we've said. So maybe those two will balance out. We're only\\nthree weeks through the quarter. There's 10 weeks to go and with supply obviously still being fragile things\\ncan change. But that's what I see today. Broadly speaking, underlying cash being similar if not a shade\\nhigher in Q4 over Q3. So working capital was a big build back this quarter 300 million, that probably is\\ngoing to fall a little. It really depends on how many units we actually build in the March, the mid February\\nthrough end of March period, but it's likely to be less than the 306 million. So we see in total of the total\\ncash to be slightly lower in Q4 even though the volumes are higher because that working capital point,\\nbut we do believe that's going to drive us through breakeven maybe up to 100 million in total for the full\\nyear.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Adrian. On the battery plants for Tata's in Europe. I think as we had mentioned earlier as well,\\nthis will be at Tata Sons entity that we are investing where you have JLR and Tata Motors as two anchor\\ncustomers and locations - India and Europe. Obviously at this point in time this is all that I can share. And\\nas and when we are ready to announce more, we will talk about that. Okay.\\nThis question is actually coming on popular demand and therefore, Shailesh, this is coming your way.\\nConsidering the strong EV order book, what is the rationale for the price cut in Nexon variant that we saw\\ntwo, three days back. And what's your take on the brand impact for the price cut? And is it supported by\\ncost reductions? Multiple people have asked it in different ways. Over to you.\\nShailesh Chandra\\nSo the call on price cut has been taken after holistic consideration taken into account multiple factors.\\nOne is that we have a future growth aspiration as far as Nexon EV is concerned and with the improving\\ncapacity and supply, I think this was one big consideration. Also, the visibility of underlying structural costs\\nand in which we have been able to reduce over the last two to three years effort of the deeper localization\\nthat we have been working on, there is also an added factor of impending PLI benefits. Also the relook at\\nrelative price positioning of our entire EV portfolio. And most importantly, keeping the value proposition\\nfiercely strong, to the change in competitive landscape. So these were the four, five factors I would say\\nthat has really gone behind this. As far as brand is concerned, I think Nexon brand enjoys a very strong\\nreferral from its large customer base of 40,000 plus now. And in terms of its value proposition, it is the\\nbest in terms of compelling mix of our best tech features, premium in-cable experience, multiple range\\noptions. I think the revised pricing action with improved range only makes it higher on consideration and\\nmore desirable for our customers. So I think is thought which has gone behind this.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nYeah. Thanks, Shailesh. There is a question on ADRs, which we thought, we explained, but we can just pick\\nit up, why did Tata Motors decide to delist ADRs, is the cost of compliance versus pressure on shares on\\naccount of shareholders who don't want to invest directly in India, management thoughts? We had\\nexplained that the original purpose with which ADRs were listed I think is probably now not relevant\\nanymore. And with the Indian market getting deeper and wider, there is no constraint on fundraise and\\nalso all our bond issuances anyway we don't need the ADRs to be listed there to do that. And at the same\\ntime compliances are getting more complicated and therefore we just decided the risk reward equation\\none looked at it, it didn’t make sense for us to continue as part of simplification, we have knocked it off.\\nThat's the background to it. They stand delisted as of yesterday. What is now the net auto debt\\ndeleveraging timeline for Tata Motors? I thought I already covered it. Maybe I'll just talk about the second\\none. How does the listing of Tata Technologies help towards that. We have announced our intention. It's\\nnow a Tata Technologies Board decision and therefore we will be working with them closely. Question\\nfrom Gunjan. Could you talk about the impact of RDE for both CV and PV. I think Girish you already covered\\nthat piece. Also an update on the discounting trends in CV industry, update on the Tiago EV order book,\\nShailesh, and we've already talked about the price cut in Nexon. Why don't you finish that and then I'll go\\nto JLR on the VME trend.\\nGirish Wagh\\nYeah. So I think on the discounting as we have been speaking about it for the medium and heavies and\\nintermediate and light commercial vehicles we have started pulling back the discounts from the month of\\nSeptember and we see a good impact of that flowing into our results for Q3. And we will continue to be\\non this path even in Q4 to bring down the discount and also bring more transparency in the systems. As\\nfar as the small commercial vehicles are concerned, I think this discount reduction journey we have started\\neven earlier right from Q1 of this year. We will continue that as well and ensure that finally it helps us\\nbuild margins in each of the product lengths. Shailesh?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nAs far as Tiago EV order book is concerned, I already mentioned that we had crossed 20,000, which was\\nthe size, which we had kept for the introductory price. So, that is the status as of now. As far as delivery\\nis concerned, we started the deliveries, we started the supplies I would say last month itself. And, this\\nmonth we are ramping up and I think we have kept the target that we should always keep the waiting\\nperiod within six months and that would be the intention. We have kept some level of fungibility between\\nthe electric vehicle models that we have. So we will be able to temporarily ramp up to ensure that waiting\\nperiod is kept within period which is acceptable to the customers.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Shailesh. Adrian, the third point is coming your way. In JLR, how do we see the VME trending given\\nthe macro and aggressive pricing from EV OEM? I think Morgan Stanley also had a question on this one\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nAdrian Mardell\\nYeah, thanks, Balaji. Look, we're not seeing any signs at this point in time of uplifts in VME. Even though I\\ncan understand the sentiment behind the question I think in the environment we're in. While we still have\\nhad demand and orders increasing above supply that will continue to be the place. VME is mixed by region\\nand by nameplates, of course, and with the buyers that we have, and the customer orders we have on\\nRange Rover, Range Rover Sport, Defender, North America and China. They are the big biases within the\\ndata today. You know the answer on VME is 0%, 0%, 0%, 0% and 0%. So with this level of order intake and\\nthe buyers to those products and our instability within the production and supply pipelines, we will\\ncontinue to be very, very low. There will be a point in time where that will start to lift. So another question\\nyou asked about what normal is. If normal is 40,000 units a month plus for us, which it likely is I think it's\\nreasonable to assume at this point we will be passing more, but those non-big three units to the other\\nregions. And then VME will start to gradually lift to 2%, 2.5% level at some point. We're not seeing any\\nsign of that within the data we have today.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Next question I move to Raghunandhan from Emkay. His other questions have been answered,\\nbut there's one that is new, which is on the EV, PV subsidiary from when would you get PLI scheme\\nbenefits and are you currently accounting, how are you accounting these incentive?. As far as the PLI\\nbenefits itself is concerned, the key is to ensure that the domestic value addition norms are met and we\\nare getting our vehicles accordingly certified. And at this point and once the financial year is over, then\\nyou file for the PLI benefits and you get it subsequently. Given the fluidity of the situation at this point in\\ntime and we are going through the process and this is first time that we will be filing this year currently\\nno accrual is being done on these incentives and once we get one round of things coming through then\\nwe will be in a position to review on that one. Okay. Capacity - I think Hitesh Goyal of CLSA. What is the\\ndomestic passenger vehicle capacity currently and when is the Ford capacity coming on stream?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah. So as far as our capacity is concerned, we have been now at around 50,000 per month. We have\\nfurther the ability to debottleneck the capacities in our two plants, which is in Pune and Sanand, which is\\nthe existing facility not the Ford one by an additional 10% to 15%. And we are targeting to operationalize\\nthe Ford plant in 12 to 18 months timing.\\nPB Balaji\\nYeah. Thank you. I think there is a question from Jinesh on passenger vehicle. A sharp drop in other\\nexpenses on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Was there any one-offs? I think most of it is linked to just cost\\nphasing across quarters nothing to read and then beyond routine stuff there. Then other one is in terms\\nof when can you expect to see these exciting products that were displayed in the Auto Expo?\\nShailesh Chandra\\nYeah. So none of these products were concepts. These are products all going to come in two, three years\\ntimeline. We already mentioned about that Harrier EV is going to come in 2024. Sierra and Avinya will\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\ncome in 2025. These were the three electric vehicle products that we had shown. Tiago is already\\nlaunched, that was the fourth one. As far as ICE products are concerned, Curvv is also going to come in\\n2024. Then the CNG models which were twin cylinder model of Punch and Altroz already mentioned\\nearlier that it's going to come in the first half of the next financial year.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Ben, the next question is from Jemma. Can you confirm if you are still be looking to use cash\\nto repay the 2023 maturities versus refinancing through the markets and the breakeven guidance implies\\nGBP 300 million FCF for the last quarter, which I think Adrian has already addressed that. So Ben can to\\ntake the first piece?\\nBennet Birgbauer\\nYeah, on the refinancing, so I think the default or base plan is that we had an expectation of circa GBP 750\\nmillion, GBP 800 million of cash flow in the second half which Adrian already talked about and that would\\nbe sufficient to cover the two bonds we have maturing in February and March for GBP 800 million\\nequivalent and it's probably also worth mentioning that in June of this year, we had a GBP600 million\\nequivalent on China bank loan due to mature and actually we've signed an agreement in January to extend\\nthat for three years from January of this year so maturing, the facility would end in January 2026. There\\nare annual reviews, so we've at least pushed out the maturity until January of 2024.\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks, Ben. The next set of questions coming in from Kapil Singh. First one to you Shailesh, Tiago EV,\\nwhat's the percentage of first-time buyers that you're seeing in the order book?\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nFirst-time buyers are roughly 25% to 30% is what we are seeing, who are buying a car for the first time\\nthat's substantial in Electric Vehicle. We have never seen this. Mostly the people had both buying this as\\na second or the third car although high percentage was using this as the only car and also the primary car.\\nThe first-time buyers we have seen significant size of buyers.\\n\\nPB Balaji\\nYeah and related question - is this gross margin dilutive for the PV business? At the initial stages, yes. But\\nafter that it will start trending towards the margins of the main vehicle we will be making. But that's over\\na period of time, but that's part of the planning that we have for the overall portfolio. CV sentiment index,\\nGirish. What's your latest update since you track it?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nGirish Wagh\\nI think in M&HCV cargo we have seen some softening, but I can probably attribute that to the post festive\\nseason drop in freight. So future expectations still remains strong. In tippers the sentiment index has\\nimproved marginally. But that is also expected because the previous one was during monsoons where the\\ntipper usage is low. In ILCV it has dipped a bit again because of post-festive season impact and for small\\ncommercial vehicles, it remains quite stable.\\nPB Balaji\\nYeah. And linked to that question from Rajesh Aynor. In the medium term how is the fuel mix change\\nhappening as far as your opinion between CNG, EV adoption in buses, ICV, MHCV’s - how should one think\\nabout it?\\nGirish Wagh\\nSo I think as we go ahead the pathway is going to be through CNG or LNG. As far as CNG penetration is\\nconcerned, currently, I think the bigger anxiety is the volatility in CNG prices but the CNG prices actually\\nwent up very fast. So that is a bigger anxiety in the minds of the customer, but the actions that the\\ngovernment has taken and once the CNG prices stabilize at this level or a bit lower level, the CNG vehicles\\ndo have an inherent TCO advantage. So one will see a fair bit of penetration happening again in ILCV and\\nSCV segments. As far as long range is concerned, yes, I think few customers will start coming in because I\\nthink the OEMs have addressed the range issue. So we have some trucks which we launched which can\\nrun for 1,000 kilometers on CNG. As far as LNG is concerned, I think this depends on availability of filling\\ninfrastructure otherwise, I think, we are ready with the product. In terms of EV, I think, one will clearly\\nsee higher penetration in buses first because of the government push. And one will also see a good\\npenetration happening in the last mile distribution due to the pull from companies who are having their\\nown net zero greenhouse gas emission commitments. I think that's how we will see EV penetration\\nhappening more in buses and small commercial vehicles.\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nMy view is that, say, if we have to take a view by the end of this decade, the mix will be around 25% to\\n30% for CNG, 25% to 30% for EV and rest would be gasoline, but with high mix of flex-fuel because that is\\nthe direction where things are going. Diesel would significantly come down below 5%. So that's probably\\nthe outlook.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. The question from Binay Singh, Morgan Stanley. We are seeing price cuts in EVs in China and\\nother regions. Do you see that as a risk to ICE pricing for the entry level cars? As well as JLR launches in\\nEVs as well, that's another angle. I'm saying, with the price cuts that we're seeing in China, do you see that\\nas a risk to the ICE pricing for Jaguar entry and mid LRs and EV profitability as JLR launches its EVs in 2024?\\nAdrian Mardell\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Motors Limited\\nJanuary 25, 2023\\n\\nYeah. No, we don't. At this point actually recognizing that a lot of our smaller units, smaller value\\ntransacting price units in China are generated within China within the joint venture. We don't see any risk\\nat this point in time or any evidence of this weakening of prices for any of our imported, more to the point\\nin fact, the VME reference back to the previous question, the average VME last quarter, which will be the\\nfirst sign of that weakening of course, the average VME last quarter was as low as 0.8% across all units\\nimported into China. So we're seeing very, very low levels and strong demand at this point.\\nPB Balaji\\nThanks. And on the PV side we already answered the question on the EV price cuts that have happened,\\nbut there's an another angle to it, with the raw material cost index not coming down, how do you see the\\nEV profitability going forward?\\n\\nShailesh Chandra\\nI think we need to keep in mind that one, there is a relative premium that a customer is ready to pay for\\nEV versus ICE and that is about 25% to 30%. ICE prices are going to go up, so therefore it will support the\\nhigher price for EVs while the secular trend of the components for EVs will keep on coming down, there\\nhas been a temporary volatility that we have seen in the battery prices, which was very steep last calendar\\nyear but also it has started moderating in this year. We have to take more long-term view of the battery\\nprices, rest of the components are coming down also as the scale is increasing. So there will be short term\\npressure on the cost, because of these temporary volatilities, but we have to focus on driving the scale\\nbecause that is what is going to bring down the cost further as we are driving the deeper localization. You\\nalso need to remember that the next three, four years will be the benefit of PLI also. I think keeping all\\nthese in mind, it is going to be in mid-term very beneficial from a mix perspective.\\nPB Balaji\\nThank you. Thanks, Shailesh. I think with that we have done with all the questions that have been asked\\nin terms of just the themes rather than just the names. So if there is anything else that you want us to\\nanswer I would suggest please reach out to the investor relations team and we will be more than happy\\nto respond to you. So thanks a lot for taking the time to attend the session. We hope you found it\\ninformative and look forward to catching up with you soon. Thank you.\\n\\n\\x0c\"],\n",

I thank you very much for the\\ninterest shown in Ashok Leyland.\\nThe domestic MHCV industry witnessed a Y-o-Y growth of about 3%\\nin Q1, backed by a favorable macroeconomic environment and a strong\\nreplacement demand. Healthy growth in the end-user industries like\\ncement, steel and infrastructure as well as improvement in general\\nmanufacturing activity and consumption trends continue to stand in\\nfavor of demand from fleet operators. Good pick-up in bus demand has\\nalso augured well for the industry.\\nThe growth in MHCV segment is slightly muted, owing to the effect of\\nsome pre-buying in Q4 of last year, because of implementation of OBD2\\nnorms from April 1, this year.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 2 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Significant\\nallocation towards capital expenditure in the Union Budget 2023-24\\nwould continue to provide the necessary traction to MHCV demand in\\nthe near to medium term.\\nAs far as LCV industry is concerned, the progress of the monsoon and\\nits impact on rural demand remains a key factor to watch for.\\nOverall, we maintain our earlier guidance of 8% to 10% growth for\\nMHCV and 5% to 6% growth for LCV for the entire fiscal year FY '24.\\nThe commodity prices moved marginally northwards in Q4 of last fiscal.\\nSince we pass on the effect of commodities generally with a lag of a\\nquarter, we had some impact from this, which was, to an extent,\\nneutralized with efficient inventory management. It is expected that\\ncommodity prices would soften in the coming months.\\nAshok Leyland has been able to beat industry growth in Q1 as well in\\nboth the MHCV and the addressable LCV segments. On top of that, we\\nhave also been able to raise prices consistently, including a price hike in\\nQ1 this year. What is good to see is that the retention of such increases\\nis improving. We are also putting efforts in reducing our costs, both the\\nproduct cost as well as overheads.

Please go ahead.\\n\\nChandramouli Muthiah:\\n\\nMy first question is around some of the cyclicality of discounting\\n\\nin the CV industry. So over the past sort of seven to eight years, I think,\\nthere have been maybe a few instances where discounting slowed down\\na little bit. And we seem to be in the midst of that sort of scenario right\\nnow. But there seems to be more confidence that lower discounting in\\nthe CV industry can sustain for a longer period of time. So just trying to\\nunderstand what's giving you that confidence? And any color on that\\nwould be very helpful.\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 5 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited\\nJuly 24, 2023\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes. I mean, it is true that historically, things have happened in a certain\\nway as far as discounts are considered. But we have an opinion that\\ncurrently, CV industry is poised for a lot of change. And I think\\neverybody in our industry understands that everyone needs to invest in\\nthis new change, that is coming up on us.\\nWe have heard from our peers as well in various media reports that\\neverybody wants to focus on profitability. Of course, it is very difficult\\nto say how competition would respond as far as discounts are concerned.\\nBut generally, the feeling at least right now is that people want to\\nmaintain healthier practices and look at value selling, look at generating\\nmore profits, so that we can all, as an industry, also invest in the new\\nthings that are upon us in the future.\\n\\nChandramouli Muthiah:\\n\\nGot it. That's helpful. My second question is on the plan to\\n\\nlaunch sort of a zero-ton to 2-ton LCV over time. So I understand this is\\na pretty large volume category within LCVs, which you're not playing\\nin at this point. So it makes a lot of strategic sense to participate there.\\nIf you could give us some idea on what sort of time lines you have in\\nmind to put this product into market? And just your thought process\\naround sort of competitive intensity there, I think the zero-ton to 2-ton\\nLCV market is more competitive than sort of the 2-ton to 8-ton\\nsegments. So just any early thoughts there would be super helpful.\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes. As we also stated in our analyst meet, I think last month was that\\nwe are seriously considering an option of getting into sub-2-ton\\nsegment. As you said, it is a very attractive large sized market. And\\nhaving now achieved more than 20% market share in a relatively short\\nperiod in 2-ton to 3.5-ton gives us confidence that we can be active\\nplayer in the sub-2-ton as well.\\nNow of course, right now, it is too early to comment on the time lines,\\netc. Because this market is a very mature market, and it's entrenched\\nwith the competition that has been there for many years.

Yes. So that will take a few more months.\\nAs we said in the Analyst Meet as well, hopefully, during the year\\nsometime, we would be able to tell you more about this.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Kapil Singh from\\nNomura Group. Please go ahead.\\n\\nKapil Singh:\\n\\nCongratulations on a strong set of results. Firstly, I wanted to talk about\\nindustry growth, because first quarter has been soft. You had guided for\\nsame as well due to pre-buy. But what are the signals you are reading\\nfrom the ground, if you could talk about that?\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes, Kapil, thank you for the question. I think the momentum, the pulse\\non the ground is very strong. We don't see any kind of negativity in any\\nof the segments actually. The momentum is going well. I think, the\\ngrowth was a little bit muted like, we explained in the last call as well\\nthat there could be some pre-buying in Q4, and therefore, this quarter, it\\nwas expected that the growth would be slightly muted.\\nWe are still happy that we had a marginal growth in the MHCV segment,\\nbut especially in the Bus segment, there was tremendous growth in the\\nmarket. As I said in my opening comments that we still maintain our\\nguidance that we gave last time of 8% to 10% growth for MHCV and\\n5% to 6% roughly for LCV for the entire year. We are still maintaining\\nthat guidance. And therefore, we think that the momentum would\\nactually further increase going into quarter 2, quarter 3 and so on.\\n\\nKapil Singh:\\n\\nOkay. Great to hear. And second, if you could just talk about as you look\\nahead over the next two to three years, we have talked about market\\nshare, further expansion to around 35%; and margins, we are aspiring to\\nget to 15%, margin right? So what are the levers that you are seeing for\\nboth that are possible from hereon as we move towards that goal?\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 7 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

As far as\\nmarket share is concerned, I mean, we have been talking about the\\ndisparity in our market shares when we look at geographical market\\nshares. North and East, although we gained substantially last year, but\\nstill, we are like, 25% range there, although we have improved from\\n20% to 25% now.\\nBut we definitely want to improve our market share in North and East\\nto roughly 30% or more. And if we can do that, definitely, we could be\\ntouching close to 35% overall. Even in product segments, we have a\\nhuge opportunity in some of the specific segments. For example, like in\\nMDV buses, in medium heavy-duty buses, we have a market share of\\n50% or more. But in ICV buses, which is about two-thirds of the bus\\nindustry, our market share last year was still like around 15%.\\nWe have substantially improved in Q1 in ICV buses, and we want to\\ncontinue to do that. So I mean, we have our play very well understood.\\nWe have our actions deployed in the right place, whether it is product\\nsegments or geographies. And we hope, I mean, just, if we continue to\\nfocus on the fundamentals, whether it is product segments or\\nestablishing the right network or getting our network right in the white\\nspaces, we have right now, I think, we can move towards that number\\nof 35% in the next few years.\\nAs far as margins are concerned, I think, in the analyst meet last month,\\nwe said in the near term, we want to achieve a double-digit EBITDA.\\nAnd in the longer -- in the medium to long run, we want to aim at midteens, which is roughly around 15% EBITDA, right? So I mean, we are\\nhappy that in Q1, we could achieve double-digit EBITDA actually\\nbecause a lot of things worked in our favor. But double digit is what is\\nour focus in the near term right now.\\n\\nKapil Singh:\\n\\nGreat.

The next question is from the line of Gunjan Prithyani from\\nBank of America. Please go ahead.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nI have two questions. Firstly, on the margin. Just trying to get a little bit\\nmore color. The gross margin expansion of 200-basis-point despite some\\ncost push, it's quite strong. So I'm just trying to understand what were\\nthe levers for improvement here? And more specifically, when I look at\\nthe remainder of the year, you've got better operating leverage yet to\\nplay out. You've got steel correction tailwind yet to play out.\\nSo if you can just give us some thoughts on how we should be thinking\\nabout margins for the remainder of the year? Will we be decisively able\\nto improve where we are in quarter 1?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: Yes. Hi, Gunjan, this is Gopal. See, essentially, I know you're looking\\nat Q1 versus Q1. So what has happened last year is there are two things\\nthat have we have been actually working on. One, of course, if you look\\nat the general industry trend, there has been a softening of steel prices.\\nBut even there in Q1, there was a slight amount of steel price increase.\\nBut the pace of growth of steel price increases happened from Q1 of last\\nyear to Q3, Q4 and then coming off has been helping the industry. But\\nthat is the upside.\\nWhat have we done at Leyland? At Leyland, what has happened is, when\\nyou compare Q1 of last year with Q1 of this year, this is actually baked\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 9 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And net price realizations have\\napproximately gone up per quarter, say, by about 1.5%, 2%, and of\\ncourse, there is a mix impact etc.\\nThe second thing that has happened is, last year, as we have shared with\\nyou, we had embarked on a huge cost reduction viz., material cost\\nreduction program, which is, we had looked at bulk buying,\\nconsolidating vendors, alternative design, changing some of the bells\\nand whistles, which were actually helping to drive performance, but at\\nthe same time, getting, which was enhancing performance, but also\\nbringing down cost.\\nAll of this resulted in the first quarter itself. First quarter typically is not\\na great quarter for the industry. But we were saying that, can we hit a\\n10% margin in the first quarter? That was the internal question that we\\nhad, and we were able to do that.\\nSo three factors: much better revenues than last Q1 of last year where\\nwe then ended up with 4.4%. And this quarter, we ended up with a 10%\\nEBITDA, Q1 versus Q1. Second one is consistent price enhancements\\nthat have been able to deliver better net realizations. Third one is cost\\nreductions on the material front, which has resulted in the gross margin\\nexpansion.\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nOkay. And so for the remainder of the year, is there any further cost, I\\nguess, you're talking about the recent initiatives that you have taken, and\\nof course, the modular platform. So is there more to come from those\\ninitiatives? Or going into the remainder of the year, it's essentially going\\nto be operating leverage and steel correction, which is yet to play out?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: No, you must understand one thing. One, price increases, for example,\\nif you do it quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter sequentially, they have an\\nimpact as we move forward. That is step ladder method of actually\\nincremental improvement in the naturalization that will happen.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 10 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited\\nJuly 24, 2023\\n\\nSimilarly, when you do cost reduction, there is a reverse step ladder\\nmethod, maybe a defending step ladder method, where the costs start to\\ncome out quarter-on-quarter. So to be candid with you, in the\\nforthcoming quarters, we are expecting the benefits of the cost reduction\\ninitiatives that we have been doing for the past few quarters.\\nOver and above that is the play that if steel prices were to come up, and\\nI think the general consensus from external reports is that the second\\nhalf of the year, steel prices are going to be soft. We are already in the\\nsecond quarter, the first half is almost going to get complete. So after\\nthat in the second half, steel prices are going to get soft. So that would\\nactually add on to the profitability for the industry also. So we believe\\nthat if the industry were to grow at about 10% to 12%, which is not at\\nall bad, if you look at the 45% or 48% growth that the industry has\\nposted last year.\\nI think riding on that volume base, the industry growth, say, even by\\n10% this year, there is scope for margin expansion. And then after that\\ncomes in the operating leverage and the other benefits that you can get.\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nOkay. Got it. That's good to hear. The other question I had was on the\\nHinduja Leyland Finance. If you can just refresh us on where we are on\\nthe time lines, how long it can take for the business to demerge? I know\\nyou all raised money, but just figuring the demerger time lines there?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: Okay. I'll tell you what is happening is it's not a demerger. Hinduja\\nLeyland Finance is actually going to merge into NXT Digital. So it's a\\nreverse merger that is happening. There's no demerger. I think the time\\nlines, there are some formalities that are to be completed. Our\\nexpectation is that it should happen anywhere between Q3 and Q4.

Please go ahead.\\n\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nCongratulations on a great set of number. My first question is on the\\nnon-vehicle side. Because looking at the Q-o-Q model mix and the way\\nthe volumes have come off, and the ASP looks like your non-vehicle\\nside of the business has done very well.

So let me just start with the Power Solutions\\nbusiness first. And I want you to just keep this in context that there was\\nsupposed to be an emission norm change from July 1 2023, which\\nactually got postponed now by about 12 months. So because of this\\nannouncement of postponement which came very late into the quarter,\\nthere was some pre-buying that happened in the quarter, which would\\nimpact our Q2 and Q3 volumes as far as the Power Solutions Business\\nis concerned.\\nNow all of that pre-buying did not happen that we were anticipating,\\nbecause the announcement came like a week or 10 days in advance that\\nthe norms would get postponed. Otherwise, we would have registered\\neven a higher volume in PSB. But just keep that in mind. Although\\noverall, we are doing well. And in the whole year also, we would register\\na significant growth in our PSB volumes. But just for a quarter 1\\nperspective, you have to just keep in mind that some pre-buying has\\nhappened in quarter Q1.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 12 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And therefore, you are seeing very high growth percentages in\\nthe defense business.\\nNow even in the last call, we said that defense pipeline is now building\\nup sharply. We have just announced receipt of Rs. 800 crores order from\\nthe Army. And I think the pipeline is building up very robustly. So for\\nFY '24 and even for FY '25, we see very healthy defense volumes to\\nhappen. But just see that in context of the last year, which was not very\\ngood, right? So the base for itself was not so good.\\nOn part sales, we are very, very happy and also very confident that we\\nhave not just registered a very good increase or growth in our parts\\nbusiness, but we also continue to do so.

Don't add that stake\\nto the margin.\\nBecause what happens is discounting is one stream of activity, price\\nrealization is another stream, billing is another stream of activity, net\\nprice realization is a third stream of activity. So what has happened is\\nquarter-on-quarter, like you mentioned, as I had mentioned, the 10% to\\n12%, why is it coming? Because quarter-on-quarter, if you look at four\\nquarters, average, we would have raised prices by 1.5% to 2%, right? So\\nyou would have actually had last year maybe about 7% to 8%. And then\\nyou have another 2% coming this quarter. So sequentially, it would have\\nhad about 10% of price increases that is happening.\\nSo that the industry is also holding, which is good for us because that\\nmeans that the industry is able to absorb these prices and still deliver a\\nmarginally higher growth, which is good.\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nAnd then, Gopal, do you expect this is like, something which you've not\\nseen historically, even forget after the last two, three years were\\ndiscounting went out of control, and now you're having a great run on\\npricing.

I'm just trying to understand from a very\\nhigh discounting-led environment where net pricing was actually\\ncollapsing to environment where net pricing is going up sharply. How\\nis the industry, how is the customer base reacting to this? I'm just trying\\nto understand how far can we continue to have such run.\\nGopal Mahadevan: Let me put it in perspective and then I'll request Shenu also to add. See,\\nthere are two, three things here. Your point is right. But what has\\nhappened is, unfortunately, the cost of the vehicle went up by\\napproximately 20% to 22% in Q1 of FY '20. And what happened is the\\nwhole thing had imploded, right? Because it was bang at the start of\\nCOVID.\\nSo there is no demand, and you are launching and you are forced to\\nlaunch products for regulatory compliance with a product which was\\n20% to 25% more. It could be 13%, 14% in some SKUs, but broadly,\\nI'm saying 20%. So once that happened, the pricing power was virtually\\nnot there in the industry. And the industry always, like you rightly said,\\nalready had the practice of discounting. So then the situation went\\nsouthwards as further discounting happening for a very limited customer\\ndemand.\\nNow last year, what has happened is, after '20-'21 and then we saw in\\nQ4 of '21-'22, and maybe second half of '21-'22 demand coming back.\\nLast year, there're a lot of pent-up demand, so to speak, started to\\nhappen. Because we must understand India suddenly turned into a highgrowth economy. And you need transportation to fuel this growth. So\\nthen what happened is, whatever demand that had actually not taken\\nplace in the past, suddenly, and the axle load norms also, which had\\ncreated capacity of maybe about 160,000 vehicles had also kind of -- the\\nimpact was over.\\nSo the industry, I think the demand suddenly started to ease of last year.\\nThat is why the industry grew by about 45% to 48%.

So if this continues,\\nthe industry's breakeven point, I'm not just talking about Leyland's, the\\nindustry's breakeven point will come down quite sharply.

To be candid, the team is now\\nworking on how do we improve the profitability of the intermediate\\ncommercial vehicles even further.\\nAs far as the heavier commercial vehicle is concerned, all I can tell you\\nis that the higher the tonnage of the vehicle, the better is the margin,\\nbecause the realizations per ton improves. So AVTR range has actually\\nbeen a big success on three grounds, I would say.\\nOne is product performance. Absolutely, I would say, in certain cases,\\nabove industry, there is a clear demand pull on the product from the\\nindustry. This industry is the toughest of all the industries, if you take\\nthe two-wheeler, four-wheeler and then you take MHCV trucks, I would\\nsay that MHCV trucks has the finest and the most, knowledgeable\\ncustomers, because this is used for commercial purposes. So here, the\\nAVTR, I think as a product has had exceptional acceptance by\\ncustomers. This is one.\\nThe second one is the complexity of production has come off quite a bit,\\nwhich is why we are able to increase our throughput on production and\\neven though the tonnage of vehicles has gone up and serviceability also\\ngoes up.\\nThe third one, as far as AVTR range is concerned, is that the -- we\\npossibly will see the benefits, and we are seeing the benefits of the\\ncomplexity of production actually coming down in terms of number of\\nparts, the assembly of vehicles, the number of vendors, the inventory\\nthat we need to carry. So we're seeing that slowly happening. And as we\\nmove forward, these are things that we shared with you in 2020-'21, and\\nall of that is happening. So AVTR is crucial and an important step for\\nus.\\nArvind Sharma:\\n\\nIf I could also ask a second question more on the Bus segment.

And this\\nis primarily because of the working capital movement, which has gone\\nup from minus one day or minus two days to now plus nine days, is 11\\ndays, that is attributing to the change in the debt situation. And it will\\nkeep improving. As you see, now quarter-on-quarter, it will keep\\nimproving. And then finally, we'll end up in the better than what we did\\nin the last financial year Q4.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Amyn Pirani from\\nJPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAmyn Pirani:\\n\\nMy question was actually related to what was just discussed right now.\\nSo just sticking to the cash flows, you mentioned that capex was Rs. 95\\ncrores for the quarter. What was the investment in Switch in the quarter?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: I think, the investment in Switch, I think, we did about Rs. 200 crores or\\nso, not an investment, not in equity. There was no equity investment that\\nwas done. There were some temporary short-term loans that were given,\\nif my memory serves me right.\\nAmyn Pirani:\\n\\nOkay. But the full year...\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 22 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Whatever\\nnumbers that Balaji gave in terms of working capital days, that does not\\ninclude Switch support. And just to give you a perspective, when we\\nsaid that we have already shared with you earlier itself, I think even\\nbefore the investment meets that we had in Mumbai, we had mentioned\\nthat we will support Switch in one way or the other for about Rs. 1,200\\ncrores in the current year. That plan will not change.\\nSo whether we will do it as loan funding, whether we'll give it as equity,\\nwhether we'll give it as other instrument, is all we are actually taking a\\ndecision. But Switch business plan will continue because this company\\nis going to come out with some very good launches, both here and in\\nUK. And we are looking at two variants of LCV coming out, another\\nvariant of a bus coming out and maybe a European model bus also\\ncoming out.\\nSo we are not going to let this action slow down. So that plan will\\ncontinue, and we will continue to support and infuse funds as and when\\nrequired. But this year, I think the overall estimate, we stand by it, which\\nwill be about Rs. 1,200 crores, which we have shared with you already.\\nAmyn Pirani:\\n\\nGreat. And just on the Switch, the electric bus that you mentioned, now\\nat least in India, most of these EV buses are being bought as of now by\\nthe STUs and the model in which they are being bought is of a buildoperate kind of a model. Now do you have any initial thoughts as to\\nwhen you launch an EV Bus? Obviously, I'm guessing that over a period\\nof time, there will be a demand from the non-STU category also. So are\\nyou gearing-up for or planning to whenever you launch, bidding for\\nthese build-operate and transfer kind of projects? Or would you want to\\nfocus on the non-STU segment for these -- for the EV buses specifically?\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes. See, as far as the EV buses for the private sector, which is outright\\npurchase kind of a model is concerned, it will take more time. So we are\\nworking with the customers to penetrate into that segment or rather to\\nsay, let us develop that segment. Now there is no segment right now,\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 23 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Because it's not just about\\nthe product, it's also about a lot of ecosystem challenges that we have to\\ndeal with. So we are working with our customers on some of those\\nchallenges to be overcome.\\nBut on the STU, which is like clear and now, the only model right now\\nis the build-operate kind of a model. And you know that Switch has\\nparticipated in some of these tenders, especially in the last leg of tenders,\\nand we have won some of those tenders as well. So definitely, we are\\ngoing to try to execute those. And we are in discussions with various\\nSTUs to be to be able to do that.\\nAmyn Pirani:\\n\\nAnd if I can just squeeze-in one last question on this model. Obviously,\\nthe way the financials and the profitability will work on these models is\\ndifferent from how we have looked at the company for all these years.\\nSo how should we think about when you start -- like this will be long\\nterm, you will not make the money upfront, you will keep the asset on\\nyour books. So maybe not today, maybe later on, whenever you can, it\\nwill be helpful for us to understand how should we think of the\\nprofitability and the ROCE on this kind of a business? And how does it\\ndiffer from your existing business?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: See, Amyn, how you can possibly look at this, as a portfolio. Because\\nwe are a commercial vehicle manufacturer. We have a vision. We want\\nto be numbered in the Top 10 in the world. And we need to do a lot of\\nactions on multiple fronts, which is we have to expand our LCV\\nportfolio. We need to enhance our market presence in India. We need to\\ngrow our exports further. There are defense vehicles that need to be\\nenhanced. So there's a lot of work that's going on. This is one bit.\\nThe second bit is we also need to be a very relevant player in future\\nfuels. We cannot afford not to be there. So what are the future fuels? Of\\ncourse, there is CNG, LNG, with which we have actually got working\\nvariance. Other than what has been introduced in the past, we are\\nworking with some of the large organizations in India, which you know\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 24 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We are also having some collaboration\\nhappening on hydrogen fuel cell.\\nNow coming to EV, that is why we also had a separate company called\\nSwitch for EVs. At the moment when Switch is evolving and we need\\nto pick and choose orders as we move forward. Now that is why we have\\na company called as OHM, which is not yet kind of operationalized.\\nBecause we first wanted to do that in Switch.\\nYou will hear more about OHM in the coming months, when we decide\\nto operation it.

I mean, there are like normal vehicles like stallion\\nand now we have some armored vehicles and so on and so forth. So yes,\\nI mean, like I said in my opening comments and later even, last year was\\nnot a good year, but we do expect FY \\'24 and FY \\'25 to be very good\\nyears.

Sir, if I can just clarify. So is it water bowser and stallions that are\\nsold or is there more products, which are coming across like whether\\n6x6 or...\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nIt's a variety of products. It's not just one product. It's a variety of\\nproducts. So for example, the previous order that we have won is like\\nthe gun-towing vehicle. And also, there is some advanced kind of\\ndevelopment happening on the Stallion, right? So it's like a variety of\\nthings that are coming up.\\n\\nChirag:\\n\\nAnd sir, just one question, Gopal. If you look at the past historical trends\\nfrom quarter 1 to quarter 4 margin trajectory, if what you are indicating\\nplays out on the industry side, we have generally seen 400 bps to 600\\nbps sequential margin improvement from Q1 to Q4. Whenever industry\\nvolumes every quarter, as it keeps on moving up, margin trajectory for\\nthe industry tends to move up in this bank. Whatever the start point is.\\nExcept for one year or two years of exceptions where margins were more\\nor less stable.\\nIf that happens, then this year itself, you will end it quite closer to the\\nambition or expiration margins that you have around 15%. Is this the\\nright way given the tailwind that you have been highlighting?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: You see, this is feasible. We can't comment whether it's going to be 15%,\\n16% or no. Let the year go out. All we can tell you is that, I think, for\\nprobably the first time or maybe once or twice earlier, but we have got\\na 10% margin in Q1.\\nNow I just wanted to share an interesting data point, which we didn't\\nmention. If you look at Q4 EBITDA, where we had 11% EBITDA being\\nposted for the quarter, our revenues were about Rs. 11,626 crores.

Which means, it's roughly 30% lower, but the\\nmargins have actually not deleveraged that much at all. And that has\\nbeen possible for the reasons of the efforts that the company has taken,\\nthe pricing that the industry has been able to do, the company has been\\nable to roll out, the cost on the material side that has come off. And we\\nare also able to rein in our overhead so that you can see the benefits of\\nit coming.\\nCompany will always attempt to perform better than the industry in all\\nfronts, whether it is on products, whether it is on market penetration,\\nmarket share, pricing, etc. I think Q4 profitability can be significantly\\nenhanced from the Q1 levels. What it is, we'll have to wait and watch.\\nChirag:\\n\\nNo, fair point. It was more of a direct sale than I was trying to understand\\nbecause that's...\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes. One thing I think you need to keep in mind that last year, I mean,\\nif you look at our last six years or seven years, we went through two\\nmigrations on emission norms, the BS III to BS IV and BS IV to BS VI,\\nright? And that built up our cost significantly.\\nAnd then you know that we had this unprecedented inflation for about\\nsix quarters to eight quarters in FY '21 onwards, right? And that\\nincreased our material cost as a percentage of sales tremendously. So we\\nwere like in BS III era, roughly around FY '17, FY '18, we were still\\naround 69% in material cost as a percentage of sales, which actually\\nwent up to like roughly around 78% by FY '22 in just a span of six years.\\nSo inflation and two migrations on emission norms, right? And I think\\nwhat was good about last year, as you know, that industry had a major\\ntailwind coming out of COVID and coming out of other factors.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 28 of 30\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

The industry, we are not saying industry which is\\ngrowing, again grow by 48% in MHCV, we are saying 8% to 10%, on\\nlast year's pace. And also price realizations would not be to such a high\\nextent.\\nNow most of the effort going forward, although I'm not saying we will\\nnot increase the price, we have increased the price in Q1, and we'll look\\nat other opportunities whenever they come in. But the effort, I think, the\\nfocus would be now onwards more on cost reductions than how we can\\nreduce our cost. How we can look at value engineering? Because of\\nthese two migration changes, we have a lot of product -- new product,\\nnew aggregates that have come into the picture.

First question comes from Chandramouli Muthiah from\\nGoldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\\n\\nChandramouli Muthiah:\\n\\nMy first question is on the other expenses line. I think there's\\n\\nbeen some impressive control quarter-on-quarter. The other expenses\\nhave grown 22% Q-o-Q versus top line, which has grown close to 30%\\nQ-o-Q.

So we've been actually channelling the overall expenditure into\\nthe right things and administrative overhead, typically, which is part of the\\nother expenditure, which is approximately about Rs. 600 crores spend, I mean,\\ngive, or take some crores.\\n\\nThis is something that we have actually been able to retain it at\\nsomething like 2015, 2016-17 levels without inflationary impact. So that\\nhas been very crucial for us and middle line management. So we did 2,\\n3 things if you would notice in the current year, what has been special\\nabout the company's performance.\\nEBITDA margin in Q1 was 4.4%. It went to 6.5% in Q2, it went to 8.8%\\nin Q3 and then it was 11.0% in Q4. So you could see two, three things\\nhappening. Steady improvement in margins and faster rates of\\nimprovement in margins. This has happened because of realization\\nimprovements, operating leverage because of higher volumes and that\\noperating leverage has happened because we have been able to rein in\\nthe expenses.\\nBut you can do a trend line now going by the last 4 quarters or even for\\nthe last few years because what has happened is we are forecasting about\\nas Chairman mentioned -- I'm sure you're going to hear Shenu also say\\nthis, that we are expecting the industry to grow this year, I mean all the\\nresearch agencies have also mentioned that there is a 10% to 12%\\ngrowth. When that happens, what we would want to do is to ensure that\\nwe secure operating leverage on that growth and improve the bottom\\nline further.\\nChandramouli Muthiah:\\n\\nGot it. That's helpful. My second question is on the prevailing\\n\\nstructure for the EV business.

One is EV business is here\\nto stay and grow. And you are going to see a faster acceleration in EV\\nbusiness, which is why, as Chairman mentioned, we are extremely\\nconfident about our tapping the potential of EV and we will continue to\\ninvest into this business. It's very, very important for us.\\nThe second one is, the EV business is still nascent and business models\\nare evolving in India, which is possibly different from what is happening\\nin the rest of the world. So one of the first things that has happened,\\nwhich you rightly mentioned, but it does not happen the way aircraft\\nleasing has happened has been in e-Mobility as a service.\\nSo we would possibly see even at operators buying these vehicles from\\nOEs such as ours, and then having an operating model where they will\\ncater to the requirements of either intercity transporters or STUs or even\\nwithin the state / within the cities. I think these operators are not going\\nto go out of business. If the market changes to EV, we are going to swap\\ntheir ICE buses to EV buses. That's all.\\nSo we need to care as an industry, and we are making ourselves ready\\nas a company, to ensure that we are catering to this segment. The second\\nsegment is STU businesses where we will see a mix of both ownership\\nand e-mobility-as-a-service coming in. And the e-mobility service as\\nthings go further, will start to mature.\\nAnd will become even more profitable as the volumes start to pick up.\\nThirdly, there would be private sector ownership, where you have the\\ninstitutions, the schools, and the private operators, which I talked about.\\nSo they would also start procuring this.\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 8 of 26\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited\\nMay 24, 2023\\n\\nUltimately, the whole trick about EV is that at the moment, the capital\\ncost is higher, but the operating cost is negligible. Once these operators\\nand some of the STUs start to secure funding, they may want to actually\\ntake up an ownership model. So we are actually keeping ourselves open\\nfor all 3 models.\\nModerator:\\n\\nNext question comes from the line of Pramod Kumar from UBS\\nSecurities.\\n\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nMy first question is on the current demand environment because the\\nbiggest -- what you say, concern what the street has on the CV cycle\\nhealth as to where exactly we are and whether do we have another couple\\nof years of growth?\\nOr this is going to be the last year of growth in terms of from a cyclical\\nperspective. So if you can help us understand how's demand looking\\nfrom your vantage points, especially in the recent weeks and as you look\\ninto the next month. Because there was visible prebuy in the fourth\\nquarter. That is the expectation.\\nSo how is demand looking on the ground? And how would you look at\\ndemand from a cycle perspective and in terms of just extending it\\nbeyond FY '24 guidance. If you can just help us understand on that.\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nOkay, Pramod, thank you for the question. As Dheeraj said, we are very\\noptimistic about the industry, not just for this year, but we also think the\\nindustry would go for a long-ish positive cycle this time. Even the\\nground pulse from the customers from large fleet owners indicates that\\nthis will be a longish cycle. I mean for this year, like we said, most of\\nthe research houses are bagging the industry growth. Overall, industry\\ngrowth at 8% to 12%. And we also think that industry growth should be\\nin that direction. At least 10% or more. So yes, very optimistic.\\nI mean as far as the Q4 prebuying is concerned, that is a fact, some prebuying happened in March.

And for the\\nwhole year, we are very optimistic.\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nAnd Shenu, just extending that question...\\n\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nIf I could just add in over there just a few more points. And firstly, a lot\\nof our business is very much dependent on the economy. And as you\\nknow, India is moving at a very fast pace and is expected to become the\\nthird if not the fourth largest economy. And in that context, the growth\\nwill go hand-in-hand for our business of commercial vehicles, trucks,\\nand buses. Also, one other issue on international operations. I know\\nwe've spoken about this many times. But I'd like to emphasize that\\nduring the course of the last year, our traditional markets of SAARC\\ncompletely crashed.\\nAnd irrespective of that, we were still able to grow slightly because of\\nthe expansion we've done in the Middle East and the African market.\\nThere is hope that during this financial year, many of the SAARC\\nmarkets come back as well. So I would say that we are optimistic of\\ninternational sales improving.\\nAnd as you are saying, looking outwards personally, we feel that the\\ncycle for CV has this traditional growth of 3, 4 years. We've only had\\none good year so far. FY '24 is looking good. We don't see any\\nimmediate show blockers, which should indicate otherwise. And we do\\nfeel that this growth momentum should continue beyond FY '24 as well.\\n\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nYes. And Dheeraj and Shenu both as in which of the categories where\\nyou're seeing strength, which is kind of giving the visibility and I\\nunderstand the industry is got -- the fleet industry is got heavily\\nformalized. So I think you can engage more with the large fleet owners\\nand understand the on-the-ground situation. If you can just help us\\nunderstand pockets of strength in terms of the fleet side?\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 10 of 26\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited\\nMay 24, 2023\\n\\nWhat's working well? And where do you see further upside like\\ncategories like buses, for example, if you can make some comment on\\nthat? That would be helpful.\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nSo I would say that for us in this last year, we have -- as I mentioned,\\nwe have grown in every product segment. And the growth definitely\\nseems to be across the board, although the LCV segment has not grown\\nas fast as MHCV and even the predictions for this year are in the range\\nof around 5%, 6%. But barring that, I think we remain quite optimistic\\nfrom ICV to MAV, tractors, haulage. They are all showing quite positive\\nsignals. Shenu, would you like to add something?\\nAnd on the buses as well, Shenu, if you'd like to expand that.\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes, yes. So like Dheeraj said, I think this overall momentum will\\ncontinue in most of the segments. We have done very, very well in\\nMAV, tractor trailers and tippers in the last year as is evident from our\\nnumbers. ICV is, I think, one area where we have a lot of headroom,\\nboth in buses and trucks. So we are preparing ourselves with beefing up\\nour products, beefing up our network on this.\\nI think in FY '24 and beyond, we would like to put an extra focus on\\nICV segment because of just the headroom available there. I think on\\nthe bus side, the growth expectation is actually close to 30% or more\\nbecause buses are coming out of a very, very low base after the\\npandemic.\\nSo you know we are very, very strong. Ashok Leyland is very, very\\nstrong in the MDV side of the buses. So we are going to -- we hope to\\ngain from that momentum, that growth momentum. Even on the ICV\\nside, as I said, we are putting a lot of more focus now on both trucks and\\nbuses.

So can you\\njust help us understand what's giving you that confidence? What are the\\nfactors which will drive this and whether the modular transition on the\\narchitecture side is also part of that story? If you can just help us, give\\nmore -- get more color on that, sir.\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nSure. I think, look, one of the key areas for us that has helped us gain\\nour market share as well as the product performance of the AVTR range\\nin BS VI has been very good. And we have explained this in the past.\\nThe advantage of having this modular program has been that we've been\\nable to rationalize the lot of our supply base, which has led to a lot more\\nefficiency as well. And as Gopal was explaining, a lot of internal cost\\ncontrol has been achieved.\\nAnd as we see with the softening of the commodity prices comes in as\\nwell, we do feel the opportunities of achieving double-digit EBITDA\\nmargins and moving that further into the future should be possible with\\nthe volume growth as well, market share growth, volume growth, we are\\ngoing by the performance of the last financial year, quite optimistic in\\nterms of having identified pockets where further cost reduction\\nopportunities exist.

              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited\\nMay 24, 2023\\n\\ncycles, how does this mix change as you approach the end of the cycle?\\nCould you give some sense of that?\\nGopal Mahadevan: Well, it's an interesting question, but this industry is still a little bit\\nunorganized. But I think there are 2, 3 things that we have to remember\\nin FY '22-'23, one of the key things that has happened is there possibly\\nhas been increase in primary demand.\\nThe primary demand is coming because for the last 2 to 3 years, which\\nyou noticed there has not been any major demand at all. After FY '19,\\nwe thought that FY '20 will be a great year after -- before the launch of\\nBS VI, but it was a flattish year.\\nAfter 20-21, '21-'22, we're virtually kind of -- there was no real demand.\\nSo to answer your question, our internal estimates tell us that a lot of this\\nhas actually come from primary demand. That is why we are also\\noptimistic about at this point in time that we're sitting in the month of\\nMay, we are optimistic about the growth in '24. Because of 2, 3 reasons.\\nOne, the mix of large fleet operators versus first-time buyers, first-time\\nusers, the tilt in FY '22, '23 has been more in favour of large fleet\\noperators. The full first-time users have not come in because of 2 reasons\\nagain.\\nOne, they are also waiting for the industry to mature demand to keep\\ngoing up. The second one is interest rates have also been high. So we\\nare actually yet to see the full potential of first-time users coming into\\nmarket. The second thing is replacement demand will start kicking in\\nnow because we believe that just as Shenu had mentioned or Dheeraj\\nhad mentioned, I think this industry has a bit of potential because --what\\nis happening is, on one side, there is a lot of regulation coming in on\\nenvironment, pollution, ESG. The government is pushing for clean\\nenergy, etc.\\nOn the other side, we are a country where you have vehicles from BS II\\nto BS VI plying.

But what is going to happen is this\\ncatch up is going to happen. And in the years to come, possibly it will\\nstart in '24, it may go to '25, '26 you are going to see the replacement\\ndemand kicking in. And you will see that, that is going to be one more\\naspect that will drive the CV demand. What the growth rates are, little\\ndifficult to tell. But the other tailwind that may come up is we have seen\\nthe peaking of interest rate. And even with the high interest rates in the\\nlast year, what has been surprising has been the level of demand that has\\ncome in.\\nI mean the last year the industry has grown at about 40% or so. And this\\nhas been, with a certain amount of challenges built into it. This year in\\nmacro terms will be relatively easier but with a higher base. But even\\nwith this, if we have a 10% to 12%, it's a very good thing for the industry.\\nMukesh Saraf:\\n\\nSure, sure. And secondly, on pricing, could you give some sense on what\\nkind of price hikes we've taken so far. And how is the absorption of that\\nprice hike in relation to how the discount is moving?\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes. I think, see, firstly, I would like to say that there is, I think, a big\\nrealization in the entire industry. That our industry is going to change in\\nthe years to come, right? I mean there for all the players like Ashok\\nLeyland have to invest in the future. And for that, we cannot just remain\\nat the levels of EBITDA that we are as an industry. I think that\\nrealization is definitely there that we have to increase our profitability\\nlevel.\\nNow in terms of price realization, like Dheeraj explained, I have been in\\nthe market myself within a lot of customers and dealers. And definitely,\\nthis new modular AvTR platform-based products are being accepted\\nvery, very well.\\nI mean, especially in the higher tonnage in the tipper in the tractor trailer\\nand MAV segment, there is a lot of pull because of this new platform.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 14 of 26\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And I think we still have headroom there. I\\nmean we will play it by the market, I mean, how the market behaves.\\nBut definitely, there is an opportunity there. There's no doubt in that.\\nMukesh Saraf:\\n\\nSure. That was helpful. Any numbers you would like to give on the price\\nhikes taken so far in the month of April and May.\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: In April, we took about a 2% price increase. Just like Shenu mentioned,\\nwhat is happening unlike in the past, is the retention of the price hike is\\nalmost 80% to 90%. So we are not increasing the price and increasing\\nthe discount. The industry is also not doing it. And you know it in\\nLeyland, we have never been actually wanting to do this as a leading\\npractice.\\nSo for us, we are extremely happy about the outcome, because this has\\nbeen a great year for the industry. And why should we sell it at such low\\nmargins, there is no necessity for it. For the industry to be sustainable,\\nwe need to improve pricing and we are seeing that happening in the\\ncurrent year.\\nAnd I would also add one more positive in this. I mean, not to sound\\noverly positive, but these are facts that all of us know. One is pricing\\nretention has been better. The second one is commodity prices seem to\\nbe coming off. right? So the industry was to deal with this intelligently,\\nit should actually shift its margin base to the next level. That's what\\nshould be the outcome of this. Let's hope it happens.\\nModerator:\\n\\nNext question comes from the line of Gunjan Prityani from Bank of\\nAmerica. Please go ahead.\\n\\nGunjan Prityani:\\n\\nI had two questions.

But this is a general price increase to cover rising\\ncost as well as to increase our margins.\\n\\nGunjan Prityani:\\n\\nOkay. So the RDE related cost is fully passed through?\\n\\nShenu Agarwal:\\n\\nYes, it is.\\n\\nGunjan Prityani:\\n\\nOkay. And the second clarification was on this commodity pricing\\ncooling off. I just wanted to get an understanding as to how much of the\\ntailwind from commodities we saw in quarter 4. And when you are\\nlooking into the next 1 or 2 quarters, are we seeing there is some pending\\nbenefits still to come in because of metal corrections, steel contracts,\\nwhatever that you have visibility on?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: Hey Gunjan, what has happened is last year, the peaking happened in\\nthe beginning of the year, where there was a huge increase and all of us\\nare expecting steel prices to go further and further up etc. But then we\\nfound that there was a confluence of both domestic and international\\nfactors which resulted in the pricing cooling off a bit.\\nBut again, in the fourth quarter, the challenge was that coking coal prices\\nstarted to shoot up. And then the steel prices started to inch up a bit.\\nWhat is happening is, as you know, in this industry, especially when\\nbuying of steel is concerned, there is always a 2-month quarter lag in the\\nsettling of the prices.\\nSo we expect that when we settle the prices, there could be a little bit of\\npricing done on the Q4 range itself or maybe slightly lower. But after\\nthat, we know that China's demand has cooled off again significantly.\\nThere are other countries like Australia, which are waiting to export out\\nbecause we are also seeing a domestic glut there.\\nSo we are -- the outlook on the steel prices for the current year is that we\\nwould see prices coming off in -- Q2, Q3, Q4 itself.

Got it. That's helpful. My second question is on this investment\\nthat you've called out on the Switch mobility business, which is Rs.\\n1,200 crores progressively. And there's about Rs. 200 crores some in\\nICDs this quarter itself. So just a clarification, does this pertain to\\nSwitch?\\nAnd I want a broader understanding of we were looking to raise money\\nexternally and now we're looking to infuse this capital. This will be done\\nover how long? I mean if you can quantify the period? And what will\\nthese investments go towards, some color around that will help.\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: Well, let me first clarify this. Maybe we should have called it a shortterm loan or a loan instead of calling it ICD. This is only for Switch -okay, for the operations of Switch. There is a lot of integration, by the\\nway, between the operations of Switch and Ashok Leyland in India.\\nAs I told you, one of the most important, you heard Chairman say that\\nyou're very extremely bullish about Switch. So it's why are we talking\\nabout that, first of all, because Switch is backed by a 75-year-old\\nexperienced MHCV player like Ashok Leyland and one of the world's\\nlargest bus manufacturers and with its own network relationships\\nunderstanding of the product, understanding of the applications, etc.\\nSo this is certainly a benefit that Switch is having and that is how, Switch\\nis actually gaining acceptance very quickly in India. Now the second bit\\nof it is, while we are looking for investors, what we said is while we will\\ncontinue to look for investors, we would want to ensure that the business\\nplan of Switch continues and is on track. Because for us, this is not just\\nanother company. This is we are trying to address the future of ssAshok\\nLeyland while ICE will continue and continue for a long time.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 17 of 26\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

I think Hinduja Leyland finance is already well funded.\\nThey had Rs. 900-plus crores of qualified institutional placement being\\ndone.\\nSo we are not seeing any major investments coming in, maybe a small\\ninvestment here and there to sustain some of the smaller subsidiaries.\\nKapil Singh:\\n\\nSo what is your consolidated net auto debt?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: Consolidated what?

From when will the revenue start to flow and what\\nkind of profitability do you expect from this business to start off with?\\nIs it gross profit positive EBITDA positive? Any color you could give\\nthere? Anything on the order book that it has so that we can build\\nrevenue against these investments?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: Well, you see, as far as this is as Dheeraj mentioned, we have variants\\nto be launched -- products to be launched in light commercial vehicle 2\\nvariants, and then we have the 9-meter and 12-meter launches in India\\nas well as in Europe, and these investments are going to take up quite a\\nbit of the portion of the investment that we are planning into Switch. All\\nwe can tell you is see the market is evolving.\\nSo in the initial period, one can't expect it to straight away, become\\nEBITDA positive from year one. But in medium term, this business is\\nprofitable just like ICE business. We can possibly have greater color and\\nshare that with you in the later part of this year. Because it's a little too\\nearly to share numbers with you.\\nBut all we can tell you at the moment is which is not a kind of Switch - has got volumes already. It is actually doing both direct sale, which is\\nnot very significant, but e-mobility-as-a-service. We have supplied to\\nBMTC Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation, Chandigarh\\nMunicipal Corporation than we have started supplies for BEST. We\\nhave a couple of private orders also where they are looking at emobility-as-a-service.\\nI'll tell you is that -- and this was -- don't hold me to the date. I don't have\\nit readily, but I think 3, 4 years back, we were one of the first to start the\\nwhole e-mobility-as-a-service with the Gujarat, Ahmedabad Bus\\ntransport authority, and then followed it with Bihar.

Please go ahead.\\n\\nShubham Shukla:\\n\\nSo my first question is about our debt level, like how much is our gross\\nand net debt, like so far? And where do we see this going forward?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: Yes. I think Balaji will answer that while he's picking out the number,\\nlet me tell you that the whole strategy of the gross and net debt has been\\nthat we conservatively manage the debt to ensure that long-term debt is\\nfunding the long-term plan for the company. And we don't continue -we don't use this aspect of when the cash is there to prepay the debt and\\nthen borrow, etc., because we would want to see consistent cash flows\\nin the company. So what is happening, the long-term debt is about\\nINR3,200 crores\\nK. M. Balaji:\\n\\nThe long-term debt is at Rs. 2,900 crores.\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: And if you're asking the short-term cash...\\nK. M. Balaji:\\n\\nShort-term cash is Rs. 3,150 crores.\\n\\nShubham Shukla:\\n\\nOkay. And our average cost of fund if you can provide?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: We'll tell you, I mean, but what we have done, while we can't give you\\nthat exact number at the moment. I'll tell you that the treasury team has\\ndone a good job in locking some of the debt at fixed rates and the interest\\nrates were low. So some of the debt levels, I'm not saying the overall\\ndebt percentage is that. But some of the earlier debt that was taken as\\nthe seven quarter, which is extremely low when compared to the current\\ninterest rates.\\nShubham Shukla:\\n\\nOkay.

              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited\\nMay 24, 2023\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan: It will obviously be gradually high. It won't be very high because we\\nkeep borrowing every year. I mean we see, irrespective of the cash that\\nis there we need to manage long-term and short-term separately.\\nSo while there could be some amount of carry, it doesn't matter because\\nwhat happens is you must remember when in a situation like COVID,\\nright, when the entire thing came to a grinding halt, it was this\\nphilosophy that actually helped the company. So we were able to not get\\nworried at all about the long-term requirement of the company because\\nthat was already funded. What we needed was short-term money, which\\ncould go either through short-term loan or commercial paper, and we\\nwere able to get some of the finest rates.\\nSo going forward, I don't see an issue on the debt profile of the company.\\nBecause even on a net basis, even last year, our debt is today hardly\\npoint. I may be wrong, and the number is 0.2 or 0.25. So there's sufficient\\nheadroom for us to borrow if there is a necessity.\\nBut see at the rate that the industry is growing and with better improved\\nmargins, I believe that the pressure on the balance sheet for going in for\\ndebt will also be much, much lower.\\nShubham Shukla:\\n\\nOkay.

And this has been followed through\\nwith another 500-bus order from the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation. Of course,\\nall of this would be final, but some adjustments may happen in the volume when final rollout\\nhappens, but it's a very large order, which is material for the company and also for the\\nindustry.\\nWe can really see that the potential of EV is growing very fast in India. The company is\\npoised to launch a spectrum of exciting products. I think the double-decker, which was\\nlaunched last year, the end of last year has created a lot of excitement. It has raised the bar of\\nthe industry in terms of quality, fit, finish and total cost of ownership and also the viability of\\ndouble-decker as a transportation EV alternative.\\nSwitch U.K. is also poised to launch the E1 bus sometime in the early part of next year or\\nlater part of this year.

Thank you, Gopal. We will be happy to take your questions now.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the first question from the line of Jinesh Gandhi from Motilal Oswal.\\n\\nJinesh K. Gandhi:\\n\\nCongrats on good set of numbers. Quickly, if you can just talk about the drivers of margin\\nexpansion in this quarter? How much would have been contributed by the commodity costs\\nbenefits? And is there any reduction in discounts which we are seeing and talk more about it?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nOkay. Let me take a shot at this. Jinesh, essentially, we have seen a confluence of factors that\\ndrive margin expansion. I would say there are 4 reasons for it. And we rightly observed, so\\nwe mentioned 2, which are the most important ones or the critical ones.\\nOne is there has been improvement in realization, and we have been consistently raising\\nprices. Over the last few quarters, we have done that even in the month of January, because\\nwe believe that with the growing demand, we also need to raise the prices because there has\\nbeen a shift from BS IV to BS VI. And while metal prices are coming off, which is extremely\\npositive for the industry, we also know that there has been an increase in steel prices, which\\nhas happened over the last 2, 3 years. So, we continue to raise prices as efficiently as possible.\\nThe second one is, again, as you mentioned, steel prices have come off quite sharply. And as\\nChairman had mentioned, our expectation is that they will continue to be at these levels or\\neven a little softer in Q4, which will help in improving margins as we move forward.\\nThe third thing, which has also improved, as I mentioned before, and now I'll explain. The\\nother two are the mix of the products. We've been continuously working on the mix to ensure\\nthat the higher profitable models are being sold, and this has helped.\\nAnd finally, is the absolute volume itself. We have seen a significant improvement in market\\nshare. Just one year back in June / July 2021 or so, our market share was at about 18.5%. We\\nhave market share significantly above 30% in the current quarter. And we hope to pursue\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 6 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

This has been possible because of the exemplary performance of\\nthe AVTR range of vehicles.\\n\\nThe modular range of vehicles has been accepted very well in the market, and there's quite a\\nbit of pull in certain segments for AVTR vehicles. And I think in terms of quality, cost,\\ndelivery, total cost of ownership, fit and finish, I think AVTR range has proved itself.\\nThe light commercial vehicles have also been doing reasonably well. They have saved some\\nheadwinds occasionally, but they are on a growth trajectory. And all of this volume growth\\nhas also helped in the operating leverage you can notice.\\nJinesh K. Gandhi:\\n\\nOkay. And are we seeing a real moderation in discounts now? I mean, one of the largest\\nplayer has talked about going towards demand for model. So are we seeing a benefit of that\\non the ground now?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nI hope that the industry will, given the fact that this is an unique industry, where it is actually,\\nthere's so much of demand which would actually be a seller's market, so to speak, but we've\\nseen that there has been deals we're getting one based on price, which was absolutely not\\nnecessary. We are seeing that discount levels are coming off a bit.\\nWe are expecting that we would see a little more consolidation on that in the fourth quarter.\\nFinally, Jinesh, as you know, and to all the other investors also who have joined on the call,\\nwhat we do at Ashok Leyland is we monitor the net-price realization.\\nSo finally, what matters is what is the net delivered price to the company, and that has been\\nimproving month-on-month. We are having a sharper focus on this because it's not enough\\njust to grow, which is very important for us. It is not growth or profitability; it is growth and\\nprofitability.\\n\\nJinesh K. Gandhi:\\n\\nOkay. That's good to know. Secondly, can you talk about transition towards BS6 Phase-2?\\nHow do we plan to transit for that and the kind of price increase we would need to take to\\npass on the cost?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nWell, I think the industry is expected to raise prices on OBD2, and different players have got\\ndifferent technologies. So, we would continue to ensure that we are more than covering our\\ncosts and recover the same.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 7 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

The only\\nthing that I can say at this moment and while one can't be 100% confident on this, but we are\\nreasonably confident that we are not going to get impacted severely by OBD2.\\nJinesh K. Gandhi:\\n\\nGot it. And then last question is on the tax rate. And do we plan to move to new tax regime in\\nFY '24? Or we'll continue with the old tax regime?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nWe'll have to study the finer points and details and then take a call. I think this has been a\\nvery good budget, positive for the industry infrastructure and also some rationalization that\\nhas happened on the tax structure. But we'll have more to share as our guys, our tax Pandits in\\nthe company are going through the finer details. But at this moment, we are not able to share\\nanything else.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the next question on the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura.\\n\\nKapil R. Singh:\\n\\nCongrats on a great set of numbers. My first question is on demand. If you could share your\\noutlook for 2024. You mentioned about some of the positive catalysts as well risks and on the\\nbalance do you expect like a double-digit growth next year?\\nAnd also, for the OBD2 norms, is the last date 31st March for production? Or this is the last\\ndate for registration? And do you expect any element of prebuy?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nOkay. Dheeraj, do you want to take that one on demand or...\\n\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nSure. So, I think we've seen a very strong recovery during this current financial year. And\\nbased on all the initiatives that we heard in the budget yesterday and special focus on the\\ncapital expenditure and transportation, we do expect that this strong momentum to continue.\\nIn terms of quantifying it, I would say that depending on finally how the GDP growth rates\\nmove, our industry is very closely correlated with that. But I think all indications are that it\\nwill continue to remain a very strong year next year as well. Yes, Gopal, go ahead.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 8 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited 2nd February 2023\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nYes. So, Kapil, on OBD2, we'll have more to share possibly at closer to the end of the quarter,\\nas I mentioned, to Jinesh also because we need to get some clarity overall. But all I can tell\\nyou is that we are well positioned in terms of the technology that we are currently offering in\\nOBD that we would be able to kind of seamlessly move forward on that.\\n\\nKapil R. Singh:\\n\\nYes, I know the question was also because we all know prices will go up. We don't know to\\nwhat extent, but normally, that leads to a prebuy. So that's where the question was coming\\nfrom.\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nYes. So, it's a good question. I mean, the only point is, while it is easy to say that yes, because\\nthere will be a pre-buy. I don't think that that will be a huge driver in terms of a change.\\nLike for example, if you notice, in 2019-20, right, which was pre-COVID, the entire industry\\nwas expected to have a heavy pre-buy because of the implementation on BS VI on 1st of\\nApril. But we saw that quarter-on-quarter in 2019-20, actually, the demand was not going\\neven though the cost of the vehicles was supposed to go up quite significantly.\\nOf course, unfortunately, after that, we had an immediate Covid outbreak. I think what we're\\ngoing to see is that if the prices that's going to be raised by the industry is going to be quite\\nmaterial, you could see some amount of prebuy.\\nThe best part of this current year's demand has been that this has been quite a pull from the\\ncustomers. There is genuine demand on the ground, all industries are doing well. There's a\\nhuge amount of infra spend. So, I think even if that continues, that would be this trajectory is\\nsufficient for posting a healthy growth in the current quarter. On top of it, if there is an OBD2\\nprebuy, well, that's going to be positive. But I don't think we are planning for a material\\ndemand base increase because of OBD2, but we'll have to wait and watch.\\n\\nKapil R. Singh:\\n\\nAnd sir, second question is on margins. I just wanted to understand how you think about the\\nevolution of margins from here. So, you can probably throw light upon 3 areas. One is\\nwhether you expect further commodity benefit. Second is on pricing. And third is on\\noperating leverage because we are seeing that your other expenditure is not rising as much as\\nthe revenue growth now. So, are most of the costs related to say, travel or AMC and all are\\nalready there? Or do you expect R&D or other things that are already there in the numbers\\nnow? Or do you expect any material increase there? So just how you think about these 3\\nbuckets of costs as we head into next year?\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 9 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

You see\\nwhat we are doing in the company today is to drive operational efficiency across the\\ncompany. We have been doing it over the past several years, of course. We have had various\\nprograms and material cost reduction, overhead reduction and all that. But what we're now\\ntrying to do is slightly larger, and this has been kind of disseminated to the operating teams\\nitself.\\nSo, there is a separate team that's looking at manufacturing planning and manufacturing costs.\\nFor instance, there's a separate team on Value engineering and product cost. The third one\\nthat is there is on sales realization itself. We are doing a detailed heat mapping of what's\\nhappening in the market, what are the realizations across the various markets, how can you\\nkeep tweaking the mix and the distribution to look at improving the net-price realization.\\nI talked about realization. I've talked about distribution costs. I talked about margins. There\\nare teams on overheads. But what we are trying to do is to use digital in a more wholesome\\nway to drive productivity and reduce cost, which does not add value either to the customer or\\nto the vendor or to any of the people in the chain. So, there's a lot of substitution of effort that\\nis happening.\\nFinally, we are also looking at productivity of people, and there's a lot of engagement that is\\nhappening at the ground level. There's a huge effort in ensuring that the whole team is\\nworking towards one goal, and not giving any forward-looking statements, but our plan is to\\ndo three or four things.\\nOne, to get deeper penetration and grow the share of business in India. The second one is to\\nensure that the growth businesses, which is LCV, international, defense, power solutions,\\naftermarket, grow even at a faster rate so that this helps to devolatize the company, and\\nsecondly, also improve the margins.\\nAs I told you, the growth businesses have significantly better margins than the main MHCV\\nbusiness. And exports is going to be something that we are looking forward to because\\ncurrently, the international markets are very, very choppy, and they have not given us the\\nopportunity for growth as we would like, even though we have been growing in the Middle\\nEastern markets.\\nSo, this is going to be, for us, very important, and we would want to ensure that we are also\\nintroducing very relevant and differentiated products as we move forward. These may not be\\nvery large offerings.

So, we will\\ncontinue to look at the benefits of better deeper penetration, cost management, and more\\nimportantly operating leverage driving the profitability of the company as we move forward.\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the next question from the line of Pramod Kumar from UBS.\\n\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nCongratulations on an excellent set of operational numbers. Dheeraj, my first question is on\\nthe demand side. You did mention about segments like cements, steel and infra, which are\\ndoing well. If you can just help us understand better, given that data availability has got really\\ngood nowadays. If you can just help us understand what is the split of demand for the first 9\\nmonths for you in terms of broader end-user applications where these trucks are going and\\ncategories which are kind of performing better or categories which can still come back in a\\ngood like tipper and other categories, which we haven't spoken about? If you can just give us\\nsome more color about the demand viz., end-user demand? And what are the sectors which\\nyou are kind of optimistic and what sectors can do better?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nSee as I said earlier, it's quite a bit of detail. But broadly, let me tell you what's happening and\\nthat is one of the reasons why the industry profitability is also moving better is because we're\\nseeing that there is the demand which has increased quite significantly in comparison to the\\nother sectors in multi-axle vehicles, in tractor trailers and in tippers. These are the more\\nprofitable segments.\\nThe second one that is happening is the demand is also going for the larger tonnage. So that is\\nwhy we are seeing that the vehicles that are getting sold are the 40 tons and 49 tons. So that\\ndrives. That's why I mentioned earlier that this helps in the profitability of the industry getting\\nbetter. ICVs are important for us as a company as well and as a segment as well. We have\\nbeen gaining growth and share in the ICV segment.\\nBut obviously, the ICV segment is lesser contributing than the heavy commercial vehicles.\\nNow the other point is with respect to sectors, I think almost all significant transport, inducing\\nsectors are doing well. Real estate, again, continues even in the new budget, I think, with the\\nimpetus is that has been given you're going to see real estate grow.\\nReal estate is very important where the transportation is very crucial. Infra, the government\\ncontinues to kind of pursue on infrastructure, an investment asset growth trajectory for the\\neconomy itself. And we are also seeing that almost all industries are posting good growth.\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 11 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited 2nd February 2023\\nSo, if you look at the core sectors, if you look at cement, steel, chemicals, paper all these\\nsectors are doing very well. The other bit that is doing well where we are seeing some bit of\\nICV growth is, of course is e-commerce.\\nI think there has been a lot of change in demand pattern, especially after COVID. You see that\\ne-commerce has now become very crucial for the average consumer, and even what is\\nhappening is it is not only this. There is also optimization of logistics that is being looked at.\\nSo today, the focus has become that we need trucks, which will perform, which will deliver\\non time, which will reduce the total cost of ownership. So why I'm mentioning this is we\\ncould possibly see a trend where the replacement cycle of some of the BS II, BS III trucks\\nwhich are there or even to a certain extent, BS IV would start happening faster because today,\\nit is not about just having wheels on the road. It's about getting things on time, point to point.\\nAnd all organizations are becoming very efficient in their inventory-management.\\nSo, we see a whole host of opportunities coming in. But at the end of all of this, what is most\\nimportant is the economy must grow. That is where I think India scores and possibly, we will\\nsee industry growing over the next maybe 2 years at least going by the global forecast.\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nFair enough.\\n\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nAnd just one point to add to that. Equally, on the passenger side, as you will see, there is\\ngrowth coming in, in all areas, right, from staff transportation to schools. Also, huge growth\\nin the electric buses as well, as you heard from Switch. So, across the board, all the segments\\nare showing a very strong recovery.\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nChairman, I had missed on the passenger side completely. I think that's going to show as you\\nmentioned, a faster growth because we are quite far from the peak volumes that we have had.\\nThat's a very good point.\\n\\nPramod Kumar:\\n\\nYes. And just a follow-up on that. On the utilization side, Gopal, because there are factors\\nwhich are headwinds for the sector like rising interest rates, moderating growth rate, but\\ndespite that the industry has really surprised everyone on the monthly velocity in terms of the\\nvolumes workouts or what are getting added.\\nAnd one cannot forget the fact that the tonnage addition is significantly higher than the\\nprevious cycle because the average size of trucks has gone larger. So given all that, what is\\nthe feedback you're getting from the end users like if you have to get confidence on next year\\nbeing a good growth year, utilization of the fleet will also be very important and hence, the\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 12 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

How are\\nyou looking at utilization level, let's say, of different categories? And haulage is something\\nwhich I think you did not mention in a positive light. So, is that category still not doing that\\ngreat?\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nNo. I mentioned haulage also. I said that what is happening, I did mention haulage also that,\\nthat's also another sector that we added, all the large trucks are doing well, and so is the ICV.\\nBut the pull from the larger trucks, especially in tippers, haulage and I had mentioned tractor\\ntrailer ie., all the three. That has also improved the profitability.\\nSee, as far as next year is concerned, as we had mentioned, at the moment, all of us are\\nconfident that next year is also going to be a growth year. And given the forecast of the GDP,\\nwhich we have recently got not only for the current year, for the next year as well, we don't\\nsee any logical reason why the demand for trucks should come up because there is nothing\\nunusual that has happened.\\nIn the past, you must remember that we have had a lot of shocks, or I would say, certain\\ndevelopments like an axle load norm coming in or suddenly GST getting introduced or other\\nfactors, NBFC crisis coming in, which had actually resulted temporary contraction, but axle\\nload had a much larger impact.\\nToday, what we are seeing is as Chairman had mentioned, one is we have not yet fully seen\\nthe demand of buses coming back because the impact of COVID is just waning, and we are\\nactually seeing people having pulled back up into offices, schools. Intercity transport is going\\nto become crucial, and also STUs would want to place orders.\\nAnd now again, as Chairman had mentioned, we are not only going to see demand possibly in\\ninternal combustion, but also in EV. That is why for us, Switch is very, very important.\\nSwitch is not a portfolio. It is for ensuring that Ashok Leyland is future ready.\\nThe third bit is if the economy is going to grow and they're going to see growth happening in\\nall the major sectors, including the sectors that impacted, there is no reason for us not to plan\\nfor growth because it's not just about hoping for growth, this is a very complex industry. We\\nneed to plan for it also.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the next question from the line of Raghunandhan from Emkay Global.\\n\\nRaghunandhan:\\n\\nCongratulations team on very strong numbers and welcoming Shenu sir on the platform.

In the last few quarters, we have gradually been increasing our market share and\\nhad seen an all-round effort right from the product itself, which are performing very well, as\\nGopal was just explaining.\\nAnd at the same time, the network expansion, geographically, you will see the growth is\\nhappening across the board, across the country. And we've been able to increase our market\\nshare in every zone that we're operating in and every segment as well.\\nGoing forward, I would say that our aspiration is very much to continue this growth. And as I\\nthink something I said earlier as well, but to continue this growth on a profitable basis, we are\\nnot looking to buy market share. We want to do this through our better product performance\\non our customer care and service. We are looking forward to continuing our growth and\\nmarket share.\\n\\nRaghunandhan:\\n\\nGot it. Good luck with that. And specifically coming to Q3 revenue performance, can you\\nalso indicate how was the performance in the non-vehicle side of business?

I mean, while we don't give specific breakdowns\\non this, it has been growing at about 25% to 28% as well. And Power Solutions in absolute\\nvolume terms for Q3 has been flattish. But on a YTD basis, if my memory serves me right,\\nthey have posted nearly about 17% growth.\\nSo, these are very important business for us.

Is it fair to assume that this is coming because of\\ncommodity easing? And do we expect that a similar sort of improvement kicking in quarter 4\\nas well or bulk of the commodity correction is reflected in this Q3?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nWe do have the numbers per se because we do slice and dice it internally. You have seen\\nprice increases happening in June quarter, September quarter. We did a price increase, I think,\\nagain, in the third quarter.\\nSo obviously, we have got about 4% - 4.5% of price increase happening, right? Now that's a\\nnet-price increase. I'm giving some broad numbers. These are not absolute on the dot. The\\nsecond bit is, of course, steel prices have come off. So that has also kind of helped in the\\noverall margin improvement.

But the third bit that has happened\\nhas been the mix of the products, which I have mentioned. The industry is moving towards\\nslightly larger tonnage, which is good for the industry.\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nOkay. And this commodity tailwind will still sustain going into quarter 4 is what I'm just\\ntrying to understand?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nWe are hoping that that will happen because it's good for the industry. We've had, I think,\\n2020- 21 and 2021-22 partially were very tough years for the industry, not only because of\\nCOVID but also the soaring steel prices that were there, and it's good to see that prices have\\nsoftened. So, it's very difficult. It's a conjecture at this moment in time, whether the reduction\\nhas happened in Q3. Will we see the same amount of reduction happening in Q4 further? We\\ndon't know. But like I mentioned earlier, we are expecting that the prices will continue at least\\nat the exit rate of Q3, which is lower than the entry rate of Q3. So, to that extent, there is some\\nbenefit.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nOkay. Got it. The other one was, and I may be wrong on this Leyland Finance. I mean I do\\nsee some preference allotment there. I mean, is that something which AL has also\\nparticipated? Some color on incremental investments have gone into the Finance business.\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nNo. Actually, just to kind of give a brief update on Leyland Finance. They had a qualified\\ninstitutional placement (QIP) happening for about Rs 910 crores, which was announced. So,\\nthey are adequate on capital. And that is, in a way, for people who are looking at the Ashok\\nLeyland balance sheet will be positive because there is no demand that will come in from\\nHinduja Leyland for funding their growth plans. They are adequately funded.\\nI also wanted to share that they have also announced that there will be a merger with NXT\\nDigital, which is a court -approved process and that is also underway. So with the regulatory\\napprovals and all the necessary shareholder approvals, they'll come through, then the outcome\\nwould be that Hinduja Leyland Finance will become a listed company.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nGot it.

In fact, we've had a stronger growth in the North and East in terms of the overall\\npercentage. I mean, it has been due to the increase in the expansion of our network.\\nBut also, as Gopal has been explaining as well, there's been a strong product pool, which has\\nalso helped us. So, there's not only a Southern market growth, but it is an all-India growth that\\nwe've seen, the Western markets, Northeast, Central, across the board.\\n\\nChirag Shah:\\n\\nThis is helpful.

Is this information correct? Or you are already seeing\\nsome interest coming from small truck operators also?\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nI think if I'm not wrong, demand from larger truck operators comprise anywhere between\\n60% to 70% of the overall industry volume. And what we're also seeing is that the smaller\\noperators in some way are getting tied up with the fleets as well. And we are seeing a lot of\\npurchases from the first-time users as well.\\nOf course, from a content perspective, led by in 50s or hundreds of units. But I would say that\\nwe actually see the demand coming from all segments. It's not only restricted to the fleet\\noperator.\\n\\nChirag Shah:\\n\\nYes. And just a clarification, you indicated that at least for Q4, the commodity benefit is\\ngoing to be similar or maybe a little bit soft, right? So, is it a large part of the benefit has\\ncome through and then how one would play out will depend upon how the prices behave from\\nhere on? Is it the right way to understand on the commodity assets?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nYou are asking a tough question and asking us to peer into the crystal ball. We'll have to\\nreally wait and watch how the commodity plays out, right?\\nWhen the export duty was more on steel, there was a perception that steel prices will harden.\\nBut they haven't because the point is that the Indian prices still continue to be higher than the\\nglobal prices. So, at the moment, all we can see is visibility to fourth quarter. And even the\\nfourth quarter, the commodity prices continue to be at the third quarter level or at the exit\\nlevel as we kind of believe it will be, then it would have a positive impact.\\nOf course, if it falls even further, then it has a greater impact. But these are all imponderables\\nat this moment. But we haven't seen -- all we can say at the moment is sitting on the 2nd of\\nFebruary, we haven't seen a further decrease happening in commodity, but neither has there\\nbeen any increase.\\nSo, at the moment, it looks like it is at the third quarter levels. The 1st of April, I mean, in Q1\\nof next year, we'll have to really wait and watch to see what happens in the global commodity\\nmarkets. Because it's not just about Indian commodity, right? It is a lot of things is going to\\ndepend on the global demand-supply condition also. So, we'll cross the bridge when it comes\\nthen.\\n\\nChirag Shah:\\n\\nAnd we are a kind of a quarter lag, right, for the impact to flow through for us?\\n\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 19 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

So, there is FG inventory, that is RM and WIP, which is there, then so\\nwhen that needs to get used in.\\nAnd then typically, the industry also doesn't settle on a month-on-month. You know the steel\\nindustry; these are done on a quarterly basis. So, we have to actively engage with them to\\nsettle these prices.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the next question from the line of Arvind Sharma from Citi.\\n\\nArvind Sharma:\\n\\nJust 1 question on the net debt. If you could just explain how it has progressed from last year\\nend, essentially the free cash flow generation, capex and how the net debt has progressed over\\nthe last 3 quarters?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nYes. Our net debt now is about Rs 2,043 crores, and in Q3 of FY '22 it was Rs 2,697. I think\\nthe number was almost the same, Rs 2,677 in Q2 of FY '23 also. The capex is roughly about\\nRs 346 crores.\\nSo, we are well on track and are conservative on the capex. We're tight on the capex, and\\nthere are multiple levels of discussions before we spend money on that.\\nAnd overall, if you look at it, the net-debt levels have been improving, and we don't see an\\nissue on that. I mean I don't know whether you have a specific question on that.\\n\\nArvind Sharma:\\n\\nNo, sir. And would you have any -- since you have some idea about the capex in the fourth\\nquarter, any idea about where we could end up fiscal '23 at? Because I mean the EBITDA\\nmargin is expected to be better given the volumes. So, do you think that this could improve\\nsignificantly over the next quarter?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nSo, you see, as I mentioned, I stand corrected on this, it's not Rs 343 crores but Rs 321 crores\\nSo, the capex was Rs 321 crores. We had at the beginning of the year, said that it will be\\naround Rs 750 crores, maybe we'll end up with Rs 600 crores.\\nAll I can tell you at this moment is we have 2 months more left. It should be lower than Rs\\n600 crores definitely. Maybe we will even take it a little lower than that, but we'll share that.\\nSo all I can tell you is it's not a material amount of capex that we have today in the current\\nhalf.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the next question from the line of Jinesh Gandhi from Motilal Oswal.\\nThis transcript has been edited for readability and doesn't purport to be the verbatim record of the proceedings.\\n\\nPage 20 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited 2nd February 2023\\nJinesh K. Gandhi:\\n\\nMy question pertains to the capex itself. I mean, given that we are expecting a strong growth\\nto continue in FY '24 and given our other investment programs, should we look at increase in\\npace of investment going forward for the future growth, both on product and capacity side?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nChairman, would you want to take that?\\n\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nI would. Yes, sure. I think on the capacity side, we are, as Gopal was saying, we are looking\\nat all the internal efficiencies that we can bring in debottlenecking within the plants wherever\\nthere are possibilities.\\nSo based on the current volume that we are foreseeing, I think we should be able to manage\\nwith the capacity that's on ground. We do not want to get into creating more overhead at this\\npoint of time. With regard to the product, as you recall, the introduction of AVTR as a\\nmodular platform, the benefit of it is that with very minor modifications, we are able to meet\\nwhatever the customer requirements are and in alternative fuels as well.\\nSo moving to whether it's CNG, hydrogen, LNG and I think that's the benefit of the AVTR\\nplatform. That was the high Capex that we went through. There are certain product categories\\nthat we are not currently present in, and we would be looking into setting up any gap that we\\nhave in the portfolio. But at this point of time, I think we are not seeing anything substantial\\nto hit our Capex requirement.\\n\\nChirag Shah:\\n\\nOkay. And just to clarify, the investment on the electric vehicle products, particularly on the\\nLCV side, will be done through Ashok Leyland and not through Switch, is that correct?\\n\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nNo, like all the products coming out of Switch, the capex will be borne by Switch directly.\\nAnd so, of course, there is an agreement between Ashok Leyland and Switch based on which\\nthese products would be utilized, but all the capex required for the electrification would be\\nborne by Switch directly.\\n\\nJinesh Gandhi:\\n\\nSo, in the Bada Dost EV product investment could be at Switch level, not at Leyland level.\\n\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nThat’s right.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the next question from the line of Mukesh Saraf from Avendus Spark.\\n\\nMukesh Saraf:\\n\\nJust one question from my side on the fleet operators.

              "  \"Ashok Leyland Limited 2nd February 2023\\nthe question here is what does this mean for us? And do we see the product mix probably shift\\ntowards larger trucks or mainly fully loaded trucks?\\nAnd on the other side, does it also mean that the pricing gets a lot more competitive given that\\nthe large operators might bargain harder? So how does this clear out for us?\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nI think from a product segment perspective, irrespective of the buyers, whether it's first-time\\nusers or whether it's fleet operator, what we see is that there is a clear segmentation on the\\ndelivery models that people require. So right from an LCV, ICV is still remaining the larger\\nsegment of the market.\\nSo, looking at the fleet tonnage between 9 to 18 tons, still is a very large segment. So, while\\nwe're looking at the whole distribution cycle, the last-mile delivery to the long distance that's\\nneeded across the country, I think we will continuously see all the different product categories\\nare growing based on the market demand. what was the second part of your question?\\n\\nMukesh Saraf:\\n\\nSo, it is basically when you deal with, say, larger operators, would it also mean that you don't\\nget that much of a pricing power with them?\\n\\nGopal Mahadevan:\\n\\nWell, I think a lot of it also depends on the demand itself and today, the demand remains very\\nstrong. And the competitiveness of other OEMs as well, how they are pricing. But as you are\\nseeing currently the prices are improving based on the current demand requirements.\\nSo I'm not seeing any decline or reduction in terms of our ability to price our products.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThat was the last question. I would now like to hand it over to the management for closing\\ncomments.\\n\\nDheeraj Hinduja:\\n\\nThank you and thank you for your interest in Ashok Leyland.

The government commitment\\ntowards their capex and possibly the scrappage scheme introduction as well, all holds good\\npromise for our sector. And we have grown our market share in the last few quarters, and we\\ncontinue to do so. And this is across the country market share growth, and across the various\\nproduct segments as well, including the passenger vehicle side.\\nSo, all in all, we remain very upbeat in terms of the prospect for this industry and for Ashok\\nLeyland as a whole.

Thank you for\\njoining our third quarter results. From our entire leadership team, I'd like to wish you, first, a\\nfantastic year ahead. We are optimistic about 2023 to deliver ground-breaking work for our clients\\nand continue on a growth trajectory. We'll talk about some of the opportunities that are ahead of\\nus.\\nJoining me today is our CFO, Jatin, you know him well; our Chief Growth Officer, Stephanie, our\\nChief HRO, Saurabh and I'm pleased to introduce you to our new Chief Operating Officer, Amit\\nChoudhary.\\nEarlier today, we reported our third quarter results as you know, I'm pleased to share that we have\\ndelivered; one, another quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Second, record order bookings of\\nover $4.3 billion, led by large deals signing of over $1 billion, a margin expansion of 120 basis\\npoints, a huge surge in cash conversion and a fourth straight quarter of lower attrition.\\nThe macroeconomic uncertainty, we had discussed last quarter continues. However, Tech\\nspending remains the robust, so our clients, they're looking for value-driven transformation, tighter\\ngovernance and improved return on investments. Cloud transformation continues to be a priority\\neven as we see a higher focus on returns.\\nIt's against this backdrop that we have delivered our highest ever bookings in total contract value\\nterms. Clearly, the investments we've been making in our clients, our efforts to bring about a shift\\nin our portfolio and proactive deal shaping- are all paying off now.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nOn a year-on-year basis, our bookings in total contract value terms grew 26% in Q3. We signed\\n11 large deals with a total contract value of over $1 billion. This strong booking trajectory translates\\ninto a 50% year-on-year growth in our large deal bookings on a year-to-date basis. And by the\\nway, our pipeline of large deals is both strong and diversified.\\nLooking at the market, three of our four markets grew more than 20% year-on-year in total contract\\nvalue terms as well. Some interesting insights worth mentioning here.\\nOne, our strong bookings were driven by Wipro's FullStride Cloud Services and Engineering\\nServices. These grew at 25% and 45% year-on-year, respectively.\\nSecond, our large deals include new and existing clients seeking a transformation partner or going\\nthrough vendor consolidation. Renewals with existing clients are often accompanied by services\\nexpansion, taking market share from others and expanding into new areas of our clients'\\nbusinesses.\\nThe deepening of our relationships with our clients is driven by our innovative solutions, improved\\ndelivery execution, higher customer satisfaction scores and finally by strong ecosystem\\npartnerships. In fact, our Customer Satisfaction Score has improved versus the previous such audit\\nby 10 percentage points. The strong order bookings proves that our business strategy is working.\\nThird, our expertise in business transformation, coupled with decades of experience in delivering\\ncost optimal solutions is the combination our clients are seeking in this market. A good example of\\nthis is a recent deal we signed with a U.S. based financial information, analytics and ratings\\nagency. The project involves integration and management of their infrastructure and security\\nestate. As their transformation partner, we will help them improve their future readiness at a lower\\ncost.\\nNow, let's turn to revenue growth. And first, I'd like to note that over the last 10 quarters, we have\\ngrown at a very rapid pace. Our revenues have grown 45% and headcount has grown by 40%.\\nWe are now much bigger in size with a breadth of service offerings and deeper client relationships.\\nIn Q3, we recorded our seventh straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth. We grew 10.4%\\non a year-on-year basis and 0.6% sequentially in constant currency terms. Our sequential growth\\nwas impacted by furloughs as expected and lower discretionary spending by clients. We have\\ncontinued to turn the tide on margins. The hard-work we've put in to improve our supply chain, into\\ndelivery excellence, operations automation has actually resulted in greater efficiencies. All this has\\ncontributed to a margin expansion of of 120 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Our operating margin\\ntherefore is now at 16.3% versus 15.1% last quarter.\\nA little later I'll ask Jatin to talk to you in more details about margin, but I do want to mention that\\nthis margin expansion is after absorbing the impact of three full months of salary increases that\\nwe've offered to our colleagues. It also factors quarterly promotions, as well as the restricted stock\\nunits with granted to our senior employees.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nAnother good news has been on the cash conversation side. We saw robust cash conversion for\\nthe third quarter at 143% of net income. I will now share some details on our service offerings and\\nsectors and how we are continuing to increase market share, market-by-market.\\nOur Americas 1 business grew 11% year-on-year in Q3. The fastest-growing sector in that market\\nwas Communication, Media and Information Services which grew at 14% year-on-year.\\nAmericas 2 business which grew 9% year-on-year in Q3, and their manufacturing led the pack with\\nmore than 18% year-on-year growth. But besides, Energy and Utilities, Securities, Capital Markets\\nand Insurance also recorded good growth of more than 12% each. Order bookings grew 40% yearon-year.\\nOur business in Europe also has continued to be a strong growth pillar, double-digit growth for\\nseven quarters in a row. Europe delivered a year-on-year growth of 12% in this quarter. Almost all\\nthe markets in Europe grew double digits, led by the Nordics, U.K. and Ireland, Germany and\\nSouthern Europe. The order book in total contract value terms grew also at 25% on a year-on-year\\nbasis.\\nFinally, our APMEA, which stands for our Asia-Pac, Middle East and Africa region grew at 7%\\nyear-on-year in the third quarter. Regions that did, I must say, particularly well during the quarter\\nwere Southeast Asia, but also the Middle East. Our transformation efforts in this region have\\nstarted yielding results. It's very visible. This quarter, we closed one of our largest deals in this\\nmarket. The order bookings, they grew 22% and are looking forward the pipeline is strong.\\nOverall, we've continued to strengthen existing client relationships and I'm pleased to share that\\nour top 10 clients grew 15% year-on-year, which also confirm our strategy around growing large\\naccounts.\\nNow let's look at the service offerings: iDEAS and iCORE. First, our iDEAS Global Business Line\\ngrew 12% year-on-year in Q3. This growth was led by; one, cloud. The Cloud Transformation part,\\nwhich grew 27% year-on-year Applications and Data, which grew 18% year-on-year, Digital\\nExperience, which grew 16% year-on-year and finally, Engineering Services, which grew 12%\\nyear-on-year.\\nNow looking at the iCORE part of the business. This global business line grew 8% year-on-year in\\nQ3. Cyber Security led the growth at 16% year-on-year, followed by digital operations and platform\\ngrowing at 9% year-on-year for Q3. From a total contract value standpoint, Cloud Infrastructure,\\nour CIS business line grew over 50% year-on-year.\\nCIS revenues now are lower as we continue to rotate our existing portfolio and move towards the\\ncloud, which is very in line with our strategy, as you know. At the same time, we are signing longterm deals with clients in this business. We are continuing to evolve our FullStride Cloud Services\\nbusiness, creating new industry offerings, working together with partners, which is in fact, helping\\nexpand our market coverage.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nFullStride Cloud Services continue to be a high-growth area for us, contributing over one-third of\\nour total revenues today. Our cloud expertise spans the entire spectrum of cloud services, from\\ncloud strategy, migration, modernization to full stack industry solutions and running and optimizing\\ncloud.\\nPartnerships continue to be a source of growth as well. Bookings with Hyper Growth Partners in\\nQ3 continued to be strong, nearly $2 billion, that's a 35% year-on-year growth. Bookings through\\nhyperscalers today stand at 44% of Wipro's overall booking in terms of total contract value. Besides\\ncloud, we are expanding capabilities in artificial intelligence, data and engineering, increasingly\\ngoing to market as, One Wipro. And these investments are getting noticed.\\nA U.S.-based energy company has selected us to build an end-to-end greenfield fully automated\\nwarehouse in Europe. The project will allow the client to manage large sums of chemical storage,\\nwhile maintaining strict health and security requirements. This win, if we look at it brings together\\nour domain, engineering, digital, cybersecurity and health and safety capabilities. But it also\\nunderscores, how our advisory capabilities, technical and engineering expertise are differentiators\\nfor us in the market.\\nLet me now turn to our most important asset, our people. I am pleased to share that attrition\\ncontinues to drop for the fourth straight quarter. In Q3, attrition dropped to 21% on a trailing 12month basis. Our quarterly annualized number, which dropped 360 basis points quarter-on-quarter\\nare now at 17.5%. And we are confident that our focused talent strategy will result in continued\\nmoderation of attrition in the coming quarters as well, frankly.\\nSecond, we are recognizing and rewarding our talent, promoting a record number of colleagues in\\nFY '23, the highest ever, in fact, with numerically 30% more promotions than in FY '22. Our\\nleadership teams, breadth of experience, high performance standards and strong collaboration\\ncontinues to fuel our growth and our transformation.\\nAnd finally, I'm encouraged to see more diversity in our leadership ranks, which has been a focus\\nfor the past several years. And definitely, we have more work to do here, we know that. But one\\npromising change worth sharing with you is that we have more than doubled the number of women\\nsenior leaderships roles at Wipro.\\nAs these visible impactful leaders progressed their career, they demonstrate the impact diversity\\nhas on our clients, on our business and on our people. We've been strict about maintaining that\\nfocus on talent quality, high performance orientation and inclusion in our graduate hiring as well.\\nYear-to-date, we have hired and onboarded more recent graduates than the whole of previous\\nyears and actually ever before.\\nNow as always, I'll close with an outlook for the full year. We expect full year revenue growth to be\\nat 11.5% to 12% in constant currency terms. On margins, our Q3 number is now the new base,\\nand we will look to improve it further. In summary, I'll say that we had an excellent quarter with\\nrecord bookings, sustained growth and delivery excellence. Our strategy continues to pay-off and\\nwe will remain on course.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nWith that, I will hand it over to Jatin now for his comments.\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nThank you very much, Thierry. I will quickly summarize the financial highlights for the quarter. We\\ngrew 10.4% year-on-year on constant currency terms. Our margins expanded 120 basis point to\\n16.3 percentage points. If you see our ETR, it was 22.9% compared to 21.5% last year. So that\\nimpacted a little bit net income conversion. But despite that, sequentially, we delivered 14.8%\\ngrowth in net income and 2.8% on a year-on-year basis.\\nCash flow remained strong at 143.5% of operating cash flow as a percentage of our net income.\\nOur cash at the end of the quarter was 4.6 billion gross and 2.7 billion net. This is a volatile year\\nand quarter on forex. We had about $4 billion of forex hedges and our realized rate for quarter 3\\nwas 82.24. As Thierry mentioned, we have guided for 11.5% to 12% growth in constant currency\\nterms for the FY'22-23 at the exchange rates, which are mentioned in our PR. Thank you very\\nmuch for joining and we'll be very happy to take your questions from here.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much, sir. We take the first question from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal Oswal\\nFinancial Services.\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nI have two questions. One of the first ones for Thierry and Stephanie if she's there. I just wanted\\nto better understand, how should we look at the TCV number, the total number, not just a large\\ndeal because if you look at the Q3 print, your TCV of 4.3 billion implies a book-to-bill of almost\\n1.5x.\\nYou have been growing the TCV number quite handsomely over the last few quarters as well. How\\nshould we think about the duration of the deal wins, which obviously will convert into revenues and\\nwhen should that impact start flowing through? And B, the revenue in last four quarters, the\\nincremental revenue has been barely about 80 million, whereas your deal wins continue to grow\\nin 25% to 30% range. So, is there something which is impeding the conversion of these bookings\\ninto revenues over last four quarters?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo, Mukul, its Thierry, I will take your question. And Stephanie if you want to add, of course, feel\\nfree. But Mukul, you're right. I think the performance in bookings has been good for several\\nquarters. This quarter has been outstanding. I think we've really done a great job of not only\\ndeveloping our pipeline of deals, but also converting them into deals contracts for us.\\nWe've shown two things during this quarter, two confirmations if you like. One is that we continue\\nto see a lot of opportunities for us in the market, which confirms that this is still a robust market for\\nus. And second, that we continue to win well over competition. We continue to show healthy levels\\nof win rate.\\nFrom a type of deal standpoint, I would say, yes. The investment made on large deals now when\\nwas that 18 months ago is paying off a little more every quarter. It's the reality. It started with one\\nbig deal. And then few quarters later, another one. And then we are gaining in volume, but also in\\nconsistency. And you will hear from Stephanie that it's across the realization now. So, this is really\\nreassuring because that we get a lot of comfort from that. And I would add that there's also a\\npromising volume of a large deal in our pipeline.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nSo, the conversion of bookings to revenue that you are asking. I think this reflects a couple of\\npoints. Point one is, there is no doubt that while the market continues to be good and the\\ninvestment in tech continues to be good. There is a change that I called last quarter,\\nmacroeconomic environment, drives a certain volume of uncertainty. And that exists. There are\\nsectors, everybody will not be surprised to hear that the tech sector is a sector that has certainly\\nfelt the impact of this change in microeconomic environment.\\nSecond is probably the fact that there is a potential slowdown of, or more, I would say, volatility of\\nthe discretionary spend from clients. Third, what we are seeing is that there is not necessarily a\\nslowdown of the decision process. If that was the case, maybe we wouldn't have had such a good\\nquarter in terms of bookings. But I think the time it takes to ramp up, to launch and ramp up those\\nprograms behind may take a little bit of time. And we have to go with the pace of our clients in this\\ncontext of uncertainty.\\nAn example of that is typically deals where there has been a consolidation of vendors that we have\\nwon. And then there's a period of transition for the business to go from one partner to another. And\\nI think it is a fact of life that we have reflected in our projection. But certainly, the performance in\\nbookings, the volume of deals but also the quality of our pipeline gives us quite a nice level of\\nconfidence for the next year as well. Stephanie?\\nStephanie Trautman:\\n\\nYes, Thierry. I would just reinforce your comment in terms of the health of our pipeline, the types\\nof deals that we're winning. It is a mix of new clients. It's a renewal of existing clients who are\\nexpanding our scope, we're taking market share and vendor consolidation. And it's also a pivot of\\nour portfolio to the new. And you heard us talk about the growth in FullStride Cloud Services. So\\nvery happy with our pipeline, the health of our pipeline for Q4 and even going into next year. So,\\nthink our growth will continue, and we'll start to see the revenue converts in future quarters.\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nAnd I had one quick one for Jatin. I was a little bit confused with the employee cost number which\\nyou printed this quarter. If you look at the cost per employee, excluding the subcontracting\\nexpenses, this was a quarter where two months of wage hike was flowing through. We also had\\npromotions which took place. But your employee cost per employee in INR terms has been flat\\nand actually declined almost 2% versus last quarter in USD terms. So, what really is leading to this\\nflatness kind of a cost which actually has been managed quite well? What are the drivers which\\nare helping you keeping this under check given that I think last few quarters have been\\nexceptionally tough in terms of overall expenditure of on employees?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nSo, I think the most foundational reason Mukul, and there are three reasons. I will go through each\\nof the three. The one is the most foundational reason is that we have improved the way we manage\\nour supply chain. We have far more freshers who are part of our pyramid. So, pyramid has\\ncontinued to improve quarter-on-quarter. Second is the attrition is lower which helps us manage\\nthe cost better because to that extent there is the impact of premium, which reduces of lateral\\nhires. So overall, the most foundational reason is that we have managed our cost structure much\\nbetter.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nThe third and of course, the other third component is that we have released a lot of efficiency gains\\nfrom our fixed price projects and those get redeployed for our T&M and other work. And therefore,\\nyou don't need your employee cost remains the constant, whether you are able to add revenue.\\nSo, these are the most foundational, as I said, the cost structure improvements that we have made.\\nThe second is also that if you look at it from a considered at Wipro limited standpoint, there was a\\nrestructuring cost which was sitting in the employee cost line which was not counted towards the\\nsegment margins of 15.1% in quarter 2, but it was sitting in consolidated line which is not present\\nnow so that shows a downward path on the employee cost so that is the second.\\nAnd third is quarter 3 typically the employee cost also has certain amount of accruals related with\\nleave and other provisions, which it takes it up or down. But if you want to model it, you model it\\nbased on the first reason that I've shared, which is the more foundational improvement in the cost\\nstructure of our employees, and we'll continue to work on that.\\nThe second and third factors, the second factor was one quarter impact, which will not recur, and\\nthe third impact is seasonal, which will come back in next December, but won't recur in the future\\nquarters.\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe'll take our next question, that's from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nFirst question, any colour on the percentage of renewals in TCV. Is it consistent with the historical\\nlast few quarters or anything has changed? And how should one think about timing of ramp-up of\\nthe deals that you have signed in the current quarter, would it be like a 1Q phenomenon? Would\\nit be more like a 2Q phenomenon? How should one think about the timing?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nTo your questions, I would say, first of all, the Yes. Regarding the balance, I was trying to remember\\nthe balance between the new and renewal, what I would say, this is a as expected. There's a\\nhealthy balance, I would say. From one standpoint, the deals that we managed to extend them to\\nsometimes widen the scope, increase our presence. That's also, in particular, when we've been\\nable to consolidate some positions, but we've also had a good volume of new deals, and which is\\nquite comforting because we know that we will be able to continue to expand and grow in those\\nnew accounts as well. So, this is good balance, I would say, a good balance between the two.\\nThe second question that is about the timing, things will take to ramp up. It's a difficult question. if\\nwe are sticking to the rule that we're only guiding for the next quarter. But what I would say is that\\nfor sure, we are seeing growth ahead of first quarter. So, this projection for Q4 certainly reflects\\nfor the reason that I mentioned before, a little bit the way we are seeing ramp-ups happening, but\\nit can only go up.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nSecondly, we made a very interesting point on percentage of the order book coming through\\nhyperscalers. How should one think about the nature of these deals? Is the contract profitability\\nsimilar to regular deals, or there are different nuances one has to keep in mind?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nWell, so the first point, Gaurav, remember, back mid-2020 when we started to lay out our strategy,\\npartners was at the centre of it. And the way we grow was connecting and engaging at the strategic\\nlevel with partner who was insufficient. And so, we've clearly, we organized ourselves to be able\\nto be a lot more relevant with them. And so, we have built these teams globally with local\\nconnections under the leadership of our CGO function.\\nAnd this is paying off every single quarter ever since. At that time, I remember that the revenue we\\nwere getting from our top five or six partners was not exceeding 1/4 of our bookings. And today,\\nas you heard, we are not that far from half of the bookings coming from our hyperscalers only.\\nSo, it gives you a feel for the volume of growth that we've been driving with them. But in a very\\nstrategic way, so going to clients together, developing solutions together, literally developing\\nstrategy and going after the market as real close partners, and that is now you can ask what type\\nof deal, typically, obviously, hyperscalers are involved in most of our cloud transformation deal.\\nSo, the whole strategy that we've developed around FullStride has been paying off as well. And\\nso how you should see it as a relation that is accelerating, that is gaining muscle every day, and\\nwe'll continue to drive growth.\\nThe margin profile actually is rather good. As you can imagine, if we are improving our operating\\nmargin, so significantly, it's because the margin we are getting from our deals is going in the right\\ndirection. I think it's also, we all know that, and it's actually visible in our books that every time we\\nare taking winning a deal that is more where it's more value-based, if you like, we are able to\\ndeliver better margins as well.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nLastly, if I can squeeze one on FullStride, TCV grew 25%. This is in context of what we are hearing\\nin the market that cloud spend is likely to moderate because of the macroeconomic involvement.\\nSo, would it be more a phenomenon of market share gain for you, or you fundamentally believe\\nthat slowdown in cloud spend may not necessarily have happened as it was feared?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nIt's interesting. Your question is a good one, Gaurav. I have a view on that. And let me tell you,\\nwhat I've observed, and I spend a lot of time with the hyperscalers personally. Is that there was a\\ngap in our, there was a shortage in our ability to deliver there on their demand, just because of the\\nmagnitude of the size of this market.\\nAnd so, the fact that they are slowing down doesn't necessarily mean much in terms of impact for\\nus. I believe that with the size of these are hyperscalers, even when they are growing a few\\npercentages less, we can still grow more or less at the same speed. I remain very bullish that what,\\nwhat we're talking about cloud and what is representing today north of one third of our business\\nwill continue to gain grow in terms of proportion of our revenue mix, if you like, going forward. So,\\nmarket may slow down, we may not slow down around cloud.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nAll right. Very clear, thanks a lot and all the best.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nThank you and you too.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nGood evening and very Happy New Year. I had a couple of questions. First is on Europe. So, I\\nthink it's been a little counterintuitive almost everyone has been sort of showing very solid growth\\nout of Europe. And the geographies which we thought were relatively stronger are actually much\\nweaker. If you could give some colour on what exactly are the dynamics at play here? That's the\\nfirst question, and I had one more after this.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nNitin, indeed, I am aware of -- and I should not necessarily comment on relative trends versus the\\ncompetition. I think in the case of Wipro, what is clear is that over the last years, we have\\ncompletely changed speed, focus attention -- and our impact in Europe is different. There's no\\ndoubt.\\nI think the organization we've put in place with a focus on key strategic markets, the leadership\\nthat we've either hired or promoted in these regions the organization that we have reinforced the\\nconnections that we have built with our clients, the intimacy, the ability to combine the power of\\nour global network and very strong impactful legal leaders in this market is making a difference.\\nAnd yes, Wipro is a different competitor in Europe today than it was some years ago.\\nIs it paying off? I'm assuming, yes, it's clear that, yes, we continue to grow. We continue to see\\nnice deal. We have a nice portfolio of clients in Europe, and we will continue to gain market share\\nin Europe.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nSure. The second one was more of a clarification. So, I think, the deal wins have been sort of pretty\\n-- in the last three quarters have been pretty decent compared to the earlier quarters. And you\\nmentioned that the conversion was low because of the environment. And then if I just look at how\\nwe typically grow in the Q1, apart from one of the years where we had large deals and we grew\\npretty well.\\nIs the understanding correct in terms of the commentary that you think the level of build in terms\\nof the deals won is sort of sufficient enough that despite those headwinds, you'll actually see an\\nimprovement next year from a trajectory perspective, on a sequential growth rate if you look at in\\nthat way? Or alternatively, maybe the flip side of the question is, do you think the cautiousness by\\nclients and the view on discretionary spends and all of those, do you think that cautiousness should\\nsort of dissipate maybe as we get into the new year in the next fiscal?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nSo, Nitin, this is Jatin, Thierry and I are smiling because this is one way to talk about Q1 numbers\\nthat we don't want to talk about, so we will give it a pass. We understand your question precisely.\\nIt's a great question, but we are not at a point in time we would answer that. But directionally, the\\nfact that we are winning large deals, the TCV, the revenue, the backlog is improving, and it will\\nconvert into revenue. It's difficult to pinpoint a specific quarter that will get the boost out of it.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nSure, fair enough. Thank you so much and all the best.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We'll take a next question from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThanks for the opportunity. First on the overall deal with it, it looks like that's really strong. So how\\ndo you think about the market demand, especially, do you say north of 50 million discloses large\\ndeals. So, would we continue to see that momentum even over the next quarter? Or do you think\\nthat is making is largely going to be on hold?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nRavi, your voice came a little muffled, so I hope I understood the question. But I believe you are\\nasking some of our views on the market itself, okay? Am I correct?\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nYes, Thierry, that's right. I was just asking about the deal pipeline. Do you think the position making\\ncould slow and therefore deal wins could get a little softer next quarter?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nWhen it comes to projecting bookings, you can certainly base your level of confidence on the\\nquality of the pipeline and on your trend of win rate over a certain period of time. If I base my\\njudgment on that, I see that we have another solid quarter of bookings coming ahead of us. Will it\\nbe as good as the one this quarter -- that I don't know. I cannot tell sometimes it depends on one\\ndeal, and it makes a big difference. So, I think very confident that it will be another solid quarter in\\nterms of bookings.\\nLet's see how it goes, okay? But a little bit of reflection on the market. again, the softness of the\\neconomy, the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment is a reality. I said it in this room three\\nmonths ago, Ravi, at the time, we are not necessarily others were saying it. But this hasn't\\nchanged. This hasn't changed. In this context, I can only recognize looking at the performance and\\nthe activity in the field from our sales teams, that the tech spending remained robust. That's clear.\\nI take obviously comfort from the fact that we are winning and that we are winning nice type of\\ndeals. And if you look at being a little bit more, looking at the type of deals, you probably have\\nnoticed that we are talking about total contract value. We also look at the annual contract value.\\nWhat's interesting is that the total contract value has been our highest ever. The annual contract\\nvalue performance has been also our highest ever. And what it says to me is that we have a good\\nvolume of large deal, good volume of medium deal and good volume of smaller deal. I think this\\ntax-on, this good pyramid of size of deals also, reflect also the fact that our backlog for the quarters\\nto come is reinforcing and is getting stronger. So, reasons for us to be optimistic for the next year.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nAnd next is a question, it's a bit of a revenue and margin question. If the demand is strong, why\\nare we looking at Middle East as a geography, we talked about investing in it. I mean historically,\\nwe used to think about the Middle East as a relatively lower billing rate at lower profitable\\ngeography. So why not focus on the developed markets if supply is still tight there?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nThis, Middle East is a very important market for us. A very important market. In fact, by size, Wipro\\nis one of the big players in the Middle East. So, we are very proud of our business. We continue\\nto invest in this business, such that we've decided to establish the headquarter of the region in\\nDubai for APMEA region in Dubai. And so, we have invested in innovation lab in capabilities. We\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nhave just decided to launch our Capco business in the Middle East also a few weeks ago. And we\\nare very bullish about our, the outlook of Wipro in the Middle East over the next quarters. It will\\ncontinue to surprise.\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Surendra Goel from Citigroup.\\n\\nSurendra Goel:\\n\\nThierry, just one question. How should we think about the correlation between TCV and growth?\\nAnd the reason I asked that question is for the past six quarters, whatever metric you have\\ndisclosed ACV or TCV is up greater than 24% year-on-year, while growth in that period has gone\\nfrom 25% plus Y-o-Y to a guidance of around 8% at the higher end in the coming quarter. So just\\nwanted to understand how we should think about the correlation between TCV...\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nSurendra. So, I would, I meant it, it didn't have a demand color but more conversion point, so I\\nwould take it. The key issue is that we have mentioned in last three quarters that in the first quarter,\\nwe said our TCV growth is 32 than 28, and this quarter also has been very robust growth.\\nThe conversion has two components. It has a future timing component, when does it convert? And\\nsecond is clearly the immediate component, which is it converts into next quarter or in two-quarter\\nphenomena, et cetera, you have to appreciate the fact that we have won a very large component\\nof TCV and something that we also covered in Thierry's speech is that a large component of that\\nis in Cloud and Infrastructure Services, which are typically long-ended contracts over four to five\\nyears.\\nSo, we can give you comfort that as we enter every quarter, we are entering with a superior backlog\\nthan what we are carrying in the previous quarter and the uncertainty around discretionary spend\\nor the conversion of large deal continues to pay out in the immediate quarter. So, you are not\\nseeing this correlation in an immediate 3-quarter period that of '22, '23 that you have seen the\\nresults of -- but as we model it for future, we feel very comfortable that we are moving in the right\\ndirection of securing a better book to carry as we enter '23,'24.\\n\\nSurendra Goel:\\n\\nJatin, the ACV that you were disclosing in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of last year was all in excess of 24%\\nalso? So, this question was more around like -- I'm sure deals would have been gone, then should\\nhave converted by now. So just wanted to understand it better if you want to kind of take it offline\\nthat’s fine.\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes. And we take your point, Surendra, we can -- even in next quarterly commentary, we can cover\\nthis point specifically, but we feel comfortable that the bookings in the current environment is the\\nonly way to continue to grow, because uncertainty will always mean that in our business, there is\\nalways -- there is certain amount of projects coming to an end and only way to continue to grow is\\nto add more on the top. So, we feel comfortable, but we can cover it as we go forward.\\n\\nSurendra Goel:\\n\\nAnd just one clarification. On your comments on the margin walk. You mentioned like something\\nin the employee cost, which kind of moved away from the cost of employees -- per employee cost\\nfor IT services. Could you just kind of elaborate on that? And could you also quantify it for us?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes. So, Surendra it is quite straightforward, when you see our employee cost numbers, you see\\nit on a consolidated basis for entire Wipro Limited. As you know that we had a restructuring cost,\\nwhich was sitting in the company book. So, it was sitting in quarter 2 employee cost. But when we\\npublish our segment results and IT services, it was sitting in not in IT Services segment, it was\\nsitting elsewhere. And clearly, that restructuring cost has not recurred in quarter 3 and that has\\nreduced from quarter 2 to quarter 3, that much cost in the employee cost line when you look at\\nconsolidated Wipro Limited books.\\n\\nSurendra Goel:\\n\\nCould you quantify that, Jatin, that's for a convenience.\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes, I can quantify it, but you can also see it in last quarter's numbers or Dipak, or Abhishek will\\ngive you shortly.\\n\\nSurendra Goel:\\n\\nNo, that's very helpful, Jatin. Thank you so much.\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nAbout INR 130 crores, yes.\\n\\nSurendra Goel:\\n\\nThank you, Jatin.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Manik Taneja from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.\\n\\nManik Taneja:\\n\\nWell, thank you for the opportunity. I actually just wanted to get your sense around the margin\\nimprovement trajectory, given the fact that over the course of last 18, 24 months apart from\\nacquisitions you've invested in terms of engine especially when it came to freshers. And now you're\\ngetting much more moderated...\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nI am sorry to interrupt. Mr. Taneja, it looks like there's an audio breaks from your connection. If you\\nare on a handsfree mode, please switch to handset and speak, and you might have to repeat the\\nquestion, sir.\\n\\nManik Taneja:\\n\\nSure, thank you. I am on handset only and I'll repeat that question. So, the question was on\\nmargins. Over the course of last 18, 24 months we see transition in our margins because of the\\ninvestments that we made around are -- around our delivery in terms of -- especially in terms of\\nfreshers, as well as some of the acquisitions that we made. So now given the fact that growth\\nactually slowing down and hiring essentially is coming off, is there a timeline that you can -- you\\nwould want to essentially suggest as to us getting back to 18%, 19% EBIT margins?\\n\\nJatin Dalal;\\n\\nOkay. So Manik, thanks for your question. And as you can see, we have made a substantive move\\non margin in quarter 3. Certainly, we will protect this base and make an incremental effort for future.\\nBut right now, I don't think we should go ahead and quantify the quarter or year in which we'll reach\\na particular threshold.\\nOur effort clearly as we articulated in past also, is that we will -- these are not the margin we are\\nsatisfied with, from a medium-term standpoint, and our trajectory for our goal for medium term is\\nhigher and we'll continue to make an effort. But please be mindful that in quarter 3, we have made\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Our next question is from the line of Abhishek Shindadkar from InCred Capital. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Shindadkar:\\n\\nHi, thanks for the opportunity and happy new year. Thierry, in the preparatory remarks, you\\nmentioned about modest slowdown in the discretionary spend, was this comment related to Capco\\nby any chance? And given the fact that you have a solid U.K. European presence. One of your\\ncompetitors had highlighted that H1 could see some of the deals delayed, these could convert in\\nthe first half. Anything that you would like to comment on the same? Thank you for taking my\\nquestion.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nWhen I was referring about to discretionary spend, Abhishek, I was not referring to any units\\nspecifically. It's a reality that applies to all kind of discretionary spend. As you mentioned, Capco,\\nlet me tell you one thing. The acquisition of Capco that we've done -- when was that now, 18\\nmonths ago, was an extremely strategic acquisition. The purpose of this acquisition was to change\\n-- game changers for us in the BFSI market, be able to suddenly completely transform the type of\\nconversation that we're having with clients in order to be able to really engage with them at strategic\\nlevel and drive larger program.\\nThis is exactly what has happened. The performance of Capco quarter-after-quarter over the last\\n18 months has been very good, actually higher than what we had anticipated or expected at the\\ntime of the acquisition and that the nature of the strategic -- the strategic nature of the acquisition\\nis a reality on the ground every day. So that's -- I just wanted to be clear about this -- the Capco\\nsince you mentioned it.\\nAs for discretionary spend, I think it's -- the type of deals that the clients feel they can stop at any\\nmoment in time. And this happened with every kind of clients across sectors.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We'll take the next question from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global.\\n\\nDipesh Mehta:\\n\\nThanks for the opportunity. Just on the deal related question. So, if I look now press release contain\\nnote four, which include we report only gross deal intake and any subsequent cancellation,\\ntermination and reduction is not the part of the number. So, do we see any different trend, let's\\nsay, over the last few quarters, particularly on the termination and reduction side, which could have\\nimplication about revenue growth trajectory compared to the deal intake trajectory? Second\\nquestion is about the growth trend or demand trend. If you can provide some sense about\\ncommunication, BFSI and consumer? Thank you.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nOkay. Dipesh, thanks all your questions. So, the first one, if I understand, well, is about, has there\\nbeen more cancellation or termination? Is it what -- that's what I understood, right? The answer is\\nwe have not -- let's be very clear. We have not lost one single -- it's not like we -- there was a\\nquestion earlier in another form about is it structural. It's not -- we have not lost a client.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nWe have not lost a -- there hasn't been a big termination or anything. So, it's not like there's been\\na particular loss. That's the nature of the discretionary spend or the nature of a slightly slower\\nramp-up that is more explaining the revenue profile.\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nDipesh, if you are okay, I wanted to also clarify the earlier question by Surendra so that we\\nconclude this call answering every question. Surendra's question was for clarification, I will mention\\nthat Q2, Q3, Q4 Wipro's ACV growth was quite high, and that was -- I'm repeating 31%, 22% and\\n33%. And if I take the average of the three, it comes to around 28% growth in ACV and that -- if\\nyou see our '21, '22 growth in revenues was also 28% plus.\\nSo, our ACV growth did reflect in our revenue growth. Both numbers included Capco, so they are\\napple-to-apple. And therefore, we continue to see a strong correlation of our booking business with\\nrevenue. And if there are any other questions on this line, IR team will be very happy to take it after\\nthe call.\\n\\nDipesh Mehta:\\n\\nSorry, the second question, if you can answer.\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nSorry, Dipesh. Can you ask me again?\\n\\nDipesh Mehta:\\n\\nSo, the second question was about the demand trend, what we are seeing in communication, BFSI\\nand consumer verticals? Thank you.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nCommunication, no particular slowdown in communication, the market continued to be good. BFSI,\\nwe know by reading like you that there are some slowdowns. We haven't seen it so far. The\\nperformance in BFSI continues to be good. I think it's probably -- let's see, but I think it's our ability\\nto really connect at the more strategic level with our clients, which is getting us to place that are\\nless exposed to cyclicity, if you like, of volatility. The third sector was...\\n\\nDipesh Mehta:\\n\\nConsumer?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nConsumer is -- okay. So, the consumer actually is sensing. If you look at our performance, it's solid\\nas well. I suspect, however, that it may be a sector between consumer and retail, in particular, in\\nAmerica, which could get a little bit exposed in the foreseeable future to follow.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you.

I would now like to hand the\\nconference back to Mr. Dipak Kumar Bohra for closing comments.\\n\\nDipak Kumar Bohra:\\n\\nSo, thank you all for joining the call.

As a\\nreminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you\\nto ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the\\nconference call, please signal an operator by pressing star then zero on your touchtone phone.\\nPlease note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Dipak\\nKumar Bohra, Senior Vice President, Corporate Treasurer and Investor Relations. Thank you and\\nover to you, sir.\\n\\nDipak Kumar Bohra:\\n\\nThank you, Yashashree. Warm welcome to our Quarter 1 Financial Year 2024 Earnings Call. We'll\\nbegin the call with the business highlights and overview by Thierry Delaporte, our Chief Executive\\nOfficer and Managing Director, followed by a financial overview by our CFO Jatin Dalal. Afterwards,\\nthe operator will open the bridge for Q&A with our management team. Before Thierry starts, let me\\ndraw your attention to the fact that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking\\nstatements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 1995.\\nThese statements are based on management's current expectations and are associated with\\nuncertainties and risks, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from those expected.\\nThe uncertainties and risk factors are explained in our detailed filings with the SEC. Wipro does\\nnot undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events and\\ncircumstances after the date of filing. The conference call will be archived and a transcript will be\\navailable on our website. Over to you, Thierry.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nDipak, thank you. Hello, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining Jatin and me\\ntoday, we have our Chief Growth Officer, Stephanie Trautman. We have our Chief Human\\nResources Officer, Saurabh Govil, our Chief Operating Officer, Amit Choudhary, and our Chief\\nTechnology Officer, Subha Tatavarti. I'll start today with an overview of our financials for the\\nquarter, moving into some details of our business, the demand environment and some direction\\nfor the coming quarters. Then Jatin will go into greater detail of our operational metrics. And of\\ncourse, we'll be happy to answer your questions after this.\\nSo Q1 was another quarter of robust deal closures for us. In total contract value terms, we closed\\nlarge deals to the tune of USD 1.2 billion, which is a 9% year-on-year growth and the highest\\nbookings in eight quarters. During this quarter, we booked 10 deals in the greater than USD 30\\nmillion TCV range. Total bookings from a TCV standpoint stand at USD3.7 billion. We added two\\nnew accounts in the greater than USD100 million revenue bucket, taking the count of businesses\\nthat contribute more than USD100 million in revenue to 21.\\nSo the number of USD100 accounts has more than doubled from 10 to 21 in the last two and a\\nhalf years since we started on this transformation. All around us in almost every industry we see\\nbusinesses that have been reducing discretionary spends in response to the weaker macro\\nenvironment. That's had an impact on our revenues as well. In constant currency terms, Q1\\nrevenue grew 1.1% year-on-year.\\nThis translates into a growth of 6.1% year-on-year in rupee terms. That is very much within the\\npreviously guided range, but yes, we are seeing some softness in revenues. Despite that, we have\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nheld margin steady. Operating margin for the first quarter was 16%. This is 112 basis points, to be\\nprecise, higher than our operating margin in the first quarter of last year. We maintained margin\\nby mostly three points, improving productivity in our fixed price project, a better utilization of talent\\nand finally, by managing our fixed costs. At the same time, we continue to invest in people and in\\ntechnology to build a more agile and efficient organization.\\nThis margin resiliency is especially significant. Wipro has undertaken one of the largest enterprisewide transformations in the industry, starting November 2020. We're proud of the progress we've\\nmade since. The success of this transformation becomes clearer when you consider the magnitude\\nof this change. And when you see that we have continued to perform while we continued to\\ntransform.\\nOn one end, we were aligning to market needs and on the other, undergoing a deep internal\\ntransformation. Our focus on accelerating this transformation along with maintaining undivided\\nattention on client experience and delivery excellence will progressively translate into improved\\ngrowth and margins. We recorded an 11.5% growth in earnings per share, year on year. Cash flow\\nhas remained strong. Cash conversions stood at 130% of net income. And finally this quarter, we\\nclosed our largest ever buyback, allowing us to return USD1.5 billion to our shareholders.\\nNow, our industry, like every other, is undergoing a seismic shift with the advancement of artificial\\nintelligence. AI can and will fundamentally change every aspect of business. Anticipating this\\nrevolution, Wipro had started investing and building AI capabilities over a decade ago already. We\\nhave delivered over 2,000 global AI engagements during this time. In fact, today we are using\\nGenerative AI for multiple use cases like enterprise knowledge mining, virtual assistants, content\\ncreation, automation in software development lifecycle and for synthetic data generation.\\nTo accelerate innovations in this space, yesterday we announced a USD 1 billion investment in AI\\nand launched a new AI-first innovation ecosystem called Wipro ai360. This ecosystem basically\\nwill bring together Wipro's full range of capabilities, including solutions, services, platforms,\\nresearch and intellectual property, as well as partnerships and talent under one umbrella, with\\nadditional funding and resources to fuel our growth in this area. Also placing responsible AI\\noperations at the heart of all our AI work.\\nWipro ai360 is meant to empower our talent pool and be ubiquitous across all our operations and\\nprocesses and our solutioning for clients. This AI-first approach will unlock more value, productivity\\nand commercial opportunities for our employees as well as our clients. But first, we need to train\\nour people in this fast-moving field. Over the next 12 months, we will train our entire workforce,\\nnearly 250,000 employees, in AI.\\nFrom hackathons to challenges on our talent crowd platform-Topcoder to dedicated trainings, we\\nwill leverage our blockchain-based DICE ID platform to become the industry standard for AI skills\\ncredentialing. Demand for AI specialized talent will grow exponentially over the coming years, we\\nknow that and we'll be prepared. Subha is here with us today to share more on this. Now, I like to\\ntalk through our strategic market unit performances as always.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nIn America as one, order bookings in terms of total contract value grew 37% year-on-year.\\nRevenues for the quarter grew 1.5% year-on-year in constant currency terms. This revenue growth\\nwas led by healthcare and medical devices at 9%, followed by consumer goods and life sciences\\nat 7%. Hi-Tech and BFSI are the two sectors that were impacted the most due to softer\\ndiscretionary spends. As a result, our Americas II market declined 2.7% year-on-year in Q1. Our\\nEuropean business unit delivered a year-on-year revenue growth of 4% in Q1.\\nThis revenue growth was led by Southern Europe and Nordics, which grew 26% and 14%\\nrespectively in the first quarter. In our APMEA business, bookings in total contract value terms are\\nlooking healthy, with a 23% quarter-on-quarter growth. Revenues for the quarter grew at 3% yearon-year. Within this SMU, our India business grew 7% and our Middle East business grew 6.4%\\nyear-on-year. In Q1, we also completed the transition to the four global business line model that\\nwe had announced earlier in the year.\\nThis evolution of our business model is actually already showing up as faster time to market, but\\nalso more inclusive one Wipro customer and delivery wins. Whatever challenges our clients may\\nhave, the solution exists within our global ecosystem. And we are tapping into the talent, the\\ncapabilities and the solutions from every corner of our firm. We are increasingly able to build\\nbespoke solutions for clients and that's what is setting us apart.\\nUltimately, our focus is, and always will be, on serving our clients with greater innovation, with\\nattention to detail and with excellence. Great example of this is our recent win with a global digital\\ninteractive entertainment leader. Wipro will modernize their network infrastructure, delivering\\nimproved responsiveness and user experience. We will drive scalability to handle increased\\nworkloads and reinforce end-user security, all the while creating a platform that supports the\\nclient's expansion plans.\\nThis project brings together Wipro's architecture, consulting, cloud migration, implementation and\\nmanaged services capabilities. This win is also a good example of how Wipro can bundle solutions\\nfrom multiple partners to deliver a wide range of capabilities that are tailored to our clients' needs.\\nIn terms of the demand environment, in some ways, we are seeing tech investment normalize after\\nthe sharp acceleration in spending during the second half of the pandemic. More and more clients\\nare expecting faster return on investments and optimizing costs through increased use of\\nautomation and vendor consolidation. In parallel, we continue to see solid demand in high growth\\nareas like cloud transformation. Clients are seeking out Wipro's FullStride Cloud capabilities for\\nthe next phase of their cloud strategy. We are helping them run more efficient and agile businesses\\nand capitalize on the emerging opportunities presented by artificial intelligence.\\nFor example, a large global medical device and healthcare company has selected Wipro to\\ntransform their operations infrastructure into a modern, cost-effective and cloud-first model. Wipro\\nFullStride Cloud will deliver a consistent and Omni Channel workplace for 120,000 employees in\\n160 countries. We will help this client achieve 40% automation, cost optimization and while\\nsimplifying their global operations.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nNow, we are able to do all of this and more thanks to our 250,000 associates around the world.\\nWe want to see them succeed in their roles and their career. As part of our transformation, we've\\ncontinued to work on various aspects of employee experience, with several new initiatives to\\nstreamline policies, to streamline processes, talent support and training and development\\nopportunities. We also want to make sure employees' voice and concerns are heard.\\nOur 2023 employee engagement survey showed an overall engagement of 88%, which is higher\\nthan before and now benchmarks us to global standards on employee experience. We also named\\none of India's best companies to work for by the Great Place to Work Institute for the second year\\nin a row. But that, to me, is table stakes. We must and we will continue to improve how we provide\\nthe experience by our employees. Because all of these efforts, attrition has continued to moderate\\nquarter on quarter, coming in at an eight quarter low of 14% in the first quarter.\\nI'm confident that our long term business strategy is correct and well suited to ride the changes we\\npredict in the industry. Most importantly, I believe our business strategy will keep us competitive\\nand resilient in the future.\\nFinal word, as always, on our guidance before I close. For the next quarter, we are guiding for a\\nsequential growth of -2% to +1% in constant currency terms. We expect margins to be in a similar\\nrange as in the last few quarters.\\nWith that, let me turn it over to Jatin for his comments.\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nThank you, Thierry and good evening, good morning, everyone. I'll summarize our performance\\nfor Q1. We grew 6% year-on-year in revenue terms. We improved our operating margin by 112\\nbasis points year-on-year. As a result, we grew 14% on operating profit terms. Our other income\\nwas one of the highest in recent quarters. We grew it 110% year-on-year. Our tax rate went up\\nslightly higher and effective tax rate was 24%. As a result, our net profit year-on-year grew 12%.\\nLet me talk about cash flows and forex. We continue to convert our profits into healthy cash flows,\\nour operating cash flow for the quarter was 130% of our net income and free cash flow at 126%.\\nWe had after completion of buyback USD 3.5 billion of gross cash and USD 1.7 billion of net cash\\nin the beginning of this quarter.\\nOur forex, the realization rate was quite healthy and improved at 81.90 for quarter one and we had\\nUSD 3.6 billion of forex hedges at the end of the quarter. We will be very happy to take your\\nquestions from you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have our first\\nquestion from the line of Sudheer Guntupalli from Kotak Mahindra AMC. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nYes, thanks for the opportunity. Thierry, just a bit on the macro, unlike during some of the previous\\ndownturns, this time around, many of the macro variables are continuing to be surprisingly resilient,\\nboth in U.S. and in Europe, except for a brief period of panic around the regional banking crisis.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nSo based on your client conversations, what is the key concern or key variable that you are\\ngathering? Could it be the end of the rate hike cycle or what else could drive a return of the spends?\\nAnd if you were to second guess, how quick that could be?\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nYes, Sudheer, I really like the question you just asked. I think it's a real one. And so let me try to\\nrespond to that. Interactions with clients have more or less, I would say, a similar pattern, which is\\nthat on one end, there is no one question the fact that technology is critical to the success of the\\nevolution of the company, whatever the industry is, by the way.\\nSecond, I think it's the recognition of the fact that over the last years, there has been massive\\ninvestment made in technology. Now, and so there's certainly the fact that, macroeconomy\\ncontinues to shed a little bit of, mixed messages to, those industries and to the leaders across\\nthose industries.\\nAnd so at the end of the day, I've always been very confident on the fact that technology was, on\\ntop of each of these leaders' agenda and that, they have a lot of transformation programs in mind\\nto drive and at the same time they are a little influenced. You know, I think it's even more than\\ninfluenced. They are very aware of the fact that this climate of uncertainty is weighing on some\\npotential decisions for company to continue the same volume of investment.\\nSo they have made some choices and I think there's a certain level of cautiousness driven by the\\nfact that the macro environment is still a little uncertain. So that's what I'm hearing. And that's\\nprobably, what we're observing is actually a reflection of that, Sudheer. I think that when we look\\nat the type of deals we are winning, we are winning more deals than ever before. And that is being\\nconsistent for the last three or four quarters.\\nEvery quarter, when we look at our TCV, performance is actually solid. And I think you all have\\nthis question about the conversion to revenue. The answer is, the reality is that while we close all\\nthese deals and they respond to ambition from clients, there's a reduction of what we all call the\\ndiscretionary spend, which are typically smaller deals, shorter period and where it's probably easier\\nfor less strategy for clients to put a stop to it for some time. And so that's what we are seeing.\\nSecond question is about the perspective? What about the second half of the year? Again, really\\nreflecting on my discussion with clients. There could be a point in time where they feel, okay, we\\nhave this budget that we haven't spent yet. The year has unfolded being possibly better than\\nfeared, so it's time for us to resume the investments or the spend.\\nAnd we are getting prepared for that and whenever it happens, we'll be ready for that. But knowing\\nif it is going to happen in a month or two or three or four that I don't know. I am being I'm staying\\ncautious in the way I'm projecting an evolution of this market in which we've been for the last six\\nmonths. And obviously keeping a very, very close focus on it, we'll see, but for the time being, I\\nwould say the market we see is not dramatically different from the market we saw three months\\nago. Back to you, Sudheer.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nYes, got it, Thierry. Just an extension of that, is the panic around the banking crisis completely\\nbehind us and going forward, do you foresee that there can only be an improvement in the demand\\nsituation from where we are, assuming macro variables remain reasonably stable?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nI mean, there will be, again predicting the future, you know, we've been over the last two years a\\nbit shaken up by some macro element that we could not necessarily predict and that have had a\\nmassive impact on a lot of what has happened after. So I'm, by definition, I'll be cautious on that.\\nBut I think that, a lot of banks still have, reasonably good fundamentals.\\nAnd they are very aware of the importance of technology for their own transformation. And so, yes,\\nit will resume at some point in time. It will restart with a lot of, in particular, a lot of the consulting\\nactivities that have been reduced and where they will need to launch those large program aiming\\nat improving the efficiency of the organization and their KPIs and ratios.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nGot it, just one quick one. The USD 1 billion investment commitment in AI over three years, is it\\nfair to assume it will be largely in the M&A route?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nNo, it's not fair. Actually, the majority of it will be organic. So this is organic, it is an investment that\\nwe are already engaging now and we will accelerate it steadily over the next three years -- not\\nthree quarters, three years. Yes, there is in there a bit of budget for M&A, but we do not suspend,\\nif you like, the progression that we want to drive over the next three years to acquisition.\\nIt will come as a complement or as an acceleration, but we are already in action now.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nYes, hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple. So first, Thierry, if you think\\nabout the cut in discretionary versus, let's say, the lower ACV of deals versus what we would have\\nseen in the prior two years, which do you think is a more significant driver of the weakness? Is it\\nequally weighted or is one higher than the other? So that's the first question.\\nThe second is how are Capco and rising sort of faring in the current environment? And finally,\\nJatin, your thoughts on margins going forward and what you're thinking about, how are you thinking\\nabout compensation increases? Because we hear a couple of companies actually sort of pushing\\nit out or sort of doing away with some of it. And so just wanted your thoughts on these three things.\\nThank you.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo Nitin, so the first question was, actually, I'm not sure I can easily answer your question, whether\\nit's discretionary or ACV. By definition, what is ACV and not showing a difference with TCV is by\\ndefinition short-term deals and that includes mostly discretionary spend. So I would say, you can\\ncall it the way you want. Those are short-term deals versus large deals, basically.\\nSo that's, I don't know, Jatin, you have a better way to answer this first question? No. The second\\none is about Capco and rising. Same comment I would have made, I'm sure I have made a quarter\\nago. It's a consulting business. There's where there's a lot of discretionary spend. It's a little harder\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nthese days that it was some quarters ago. It doesn't change at all the strategic nature of these\\ndeals.\\nAnd I think it is always been clear for us that these were investments for the future and not tactical.\\nSo you have -- we know consulting our early cycle type of business. So -- and that's what we are\\nseeing. Having said that, actually, again, on the fundamentals are good. Second, I take the\\nexample of rising because that's the last addition to our organization when was that an year ago.\\nYes, about year ago. So a good go.\\nFrankly, the attraction it gets in our SAP business is beyond our expectation at the time of the\\nacquisition. There's no doubt, whether it's in our, in the way we are able to develop, true strategic\\nlevel of exchange with SAP, or in the way we are going for large transformation, large deals in\\nSAP, that rising has been a great addition to the fab. So that's the second one. The third one, I'm\\nalways tempted to respond on margin. For some reason we always ask the CFO on margin. So\\ngo ahead. Go ahead, Jatin.\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nSo, Nitin, first, what I want to share is in quarter one, despite a significant volatility in revenue, we\\nhave done well to stay flat on operating margins. And that was because of a variety of operational\\nlevers that we were able to manage very well, including improvement in utilization, which would\\nhave been, as you can imagine, quite difficult in such a revenue scenario.\\nAs we enter quarter two, we definitely want to hold on to this trajectory and we will continue to\\nleverage the efforts that we have taken in quarter one to continue with the same consistency in\\nquarter two. As Saurabh mentioned in the press release, as we have spoken about it earlier today.\\nWe did our last salary increase in September of last year and we plan to do that for this year\\nsometime in quarter three. So at least, for quarter two that's not something that, we are penciling\\nin, at this point in time.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nSure, Jatin. So on the utilization, you think, you have more room because it already seems to be\\nmaxed out. So would you need to start hiring in anticipation of demand, maybe six months down\\nodd?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo Nitin, next to me is Amit, our CEO, who is obviously driving utilization up, so Amit, over to you.\\n\\nAmit Choudhary:\\n\\nThank you, Thierry, and thank you, Nitin. Yes, utilization clearly is going to continue to be a KPI\\nthat will keep driving. We are also looking at different components of utilization, not only the\\naggregate number in terms of location, in terms of seniority. So yes, there is still some room to\\ndrive our utilization up from where we are.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nSure. Thank you, Thierry. Thank you, Jatin. Thank you, Amit. Very helpful. Thanks again and all\\nthe best.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nThank you, Nitin.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nHi, thanks for taking my question. So first question is for Thierry. The success of strategy pursued\\nby us is pretty well reflected in our higher win rates, large deal closures, and even better TCVs.\\nBut when we really compare revenue growth versus some of the peers, there is still a divergence.\\nSo how do we really explain this? Is this more to do with the portfolio mix or any other factor that\\ncould explain this gap?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nGaurav as you can imagine, I run Wipro and I'm with this leadership team working on, driving, the\\nperformance of Wipro, in the right direction. We are focusing on our priorities. We are focusing on\\nour journey. Just look at yourself, the profile of growth of Wipro over the last three years. The most\\nimportant point is, has it been a change to the previous trend of growth of this organization. I'm not\\nsure, I would, I'm not going to benchmark our performance every quarter against, every other\\ncompany in our industry.\\nWe have our own journey. We have our own gauge, our transformation. Three years ago, we are\\nworking on many different aspects of our progression, if you like. Growth has been solid, doubledigit two years in a row. Yes, there is a slowdown. It's a reality for everyone, if you want me to refer\\nto, to reflect on others as well. And that's, what I'm seeing.\\nHaving said that, I believe that, we are every day becoming more impactful in the market. As you\\nsaid, it's visible in the deals that we have closed, the large deals that we have closed. It's also\\nvisible in the way, we are growing our large account, and that is showing that, our account strategy\\nhas been paying off every single quarter for the last 10 quarters.\\nWe have doubled the number of USD100 million accounts in two and a half years. And again, it's\\na testament to the ability of the company to grow, when we are focused, whether it is in terms of\\naccount, in terms of sector, or markets.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nGreat. Second question is regarding the investment committed for generative AI. How are we going\\nto fund this investment? And if we can quantify, this would have any implications on our longerterm margin aspirations? Thank you.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nGaurav. So, funding is funded by the operations, to be clear. So this is in our plan. It's baked into\\nour plan. To explain to you a few minutes ago that, there's a lot going on in terms of, improving the\\nefficiency of our operations, of what we call our operational excellence, whether it's in the way we\\nare, injecting more automation and AI into our delivery to be more efficient, or whether it is in the\\nway, we are, streamlining of our operations, reducing the layers, and just being more nimble and\\nmore agile as an organization. All of that is driving operational improvements that we are reinjecting in our future.\\nWe've never compromised on development or mid to long term strategy. We've never\\ncompromised on the obsession for our clients and for excellence in delivery. And AI, obviously, is\\nan investment, but also a gigantic market for us. And so that's how we look at it. And so you should\\nlook and consider that, because we consider we are well positioned in that market, that it will trigger\\nrevenue growth and profitability over the next quarters\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nThank you so much.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We have our next question from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang Equities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nYes, thanks for the opportunity. Considering the demand environment, how would you characterize\\nthe competitive intensity that you see in the market today compared to, say, six months back?\\n\\nManagement:\\n\\nCompetitive activity.\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nCompetitive intensity?\\n\\nStephanie Trautman:\\n\\nSo, it is a very competitive environment as we look to renew our existing book of business and\\nacquire new clients with new opportunities. Of course, we're finding ourselves in situations, where\\nwe really have to differentiate our value proposition and drive more value for our customers. We're\\nwinning against all of our competitors. If you look at our large deal wins, this quarter, it was pretty\\nmixed in terms of, what we were winning and who we were winning against. So as Thierry\\nmentioned, our strategy is really paying off. We're better poised to be highly competitive and a true\\ntransformation partner with our clients and that's showing up in our wins.\\n\\nManagement:\\n\\nThank you, Stephanie.\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nIs the higher competitive intensity impacting pricing as we speak right now, or is the customer able\\nto extract sweeter deals from you in terms of larger productivity benefits down the road?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes, hi, Girish. I hope you are well. No, the answer right now is yes, in the sense that there is\\nnothing unusual that we see on large deals that we don't normally notice. Obviously, if there is a\\nUSD200 million or USD300 million deal, you would benchmark it with the best standards on\\nproductivity, best standards on pricing, but that is not out of ordinary behavior of dropping prices\\nor giving deferrals in billing, etcetera. Those behavior, we have not yet observed that would worry\\nus.\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nOkay, lastly on generative AI, there's been mixed commentary around the evolutionary impact of\\nthis on at least certain service lines. What's your take on this and how early or late will this happen,\\nif at all it happens?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes, so Girish, your specific question is does generative AI already, is it already reflecting in\\nreduction in revenue and potential headcount for the GBLs for our service lines?\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nNo, I'm saying, will the productivity gains that people claim or there's been claims around it, will\\nthat be entirely passed on to customers resulting in some kind of revenue compression in the times\\nahead?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes, so Girish, we haven't seen that yet. But as you already know that, every competitive deal\\ngoes with a certain assumptions of year-on-year productivity numbers that are baked in and those\\nnumbers will continue gradually. They will continue to bake in the productivity benefits that Gen AI\\nwill bake in and I would request Subha to add from her perspective, how does she see this journey\\nto unfold?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nSubha Tatavarti:\\n\\nThank you, Jatin. So Girish, we feel that Gen AI is a fundamental shift in how any business would\\ndo business or operate. So what does that mean? It means that, we will see greater and greater\\nefficiencies and productivity in every sector and every vertical. And it will also translate into, how\\nour business will run more efficiently moving forward as we begin to ramp up adoption of this\\ntechnology across every business process, every technology stack and every offering and every\\ninteraction, we have with our customers. So yes, there will be productivity gains for our customers.\\nWe hope to drive it for them, but we also see significant productivity gains for our business as well\\ngoing forward.\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Abhishek Kumar from JM Financial. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nYes, hi. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand the assumptions\\nthat have gone into our guidance for the next quarter. Last quarter, if I remember right, we\\nmentioned that, some of the clients had already intimated us about certain ramp downs and the\\nimpact was to be felt in one quarter. So our sense is that, that probably is in the base quarter now.\\nSo what is driving another, sort of at least at the lower end, another sequential decline for the next\\nquarter? Have we seen more such intimations coming our way and project ramp downs\\ncontinuing?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nAbhishek, so if you look at the guidance for Q2, it's actually showing is, I would say, a slight\\nimprovement over Q1, right? And so, what I think we are saying is uncertainty remains. There's no\\ndeterioration. No, we stay a bit cautious because of the uncertainty. Right, and that's how we see\\nthe quarter two for us.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nSure, so in terms of how the last quarter turned out, was there any stabilization towards the second\\nhalf of the quarter or the weakness of the system through the quarter?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nThis is a difficult question. I'm not sure I can answer. It's too early to tell, right? You cannot make\\na trend based on 20 days or 30 days. So I don't think, I'm in a position or Jatin or anybody here is\\nto tell you that, based on the last 30 days, we can see a trend. I think it's, this is the reality with the\\ncontext of uncertainty. It is precisely, it's a little bit erratic. And so, some industries certainly are\\nmore pushers than others. Banking, financial services, technology, you see that. technology has\\nreduced.\\nThere are actually some technology companies that have been going through several waves of\\nlayoffs, so there's a bit of a slowdown on the technology side after several years of stronger\\nacceleration of investments. Comms is another sector, where we are seeing that. Some other\\nsectors, healthcare, energy utilities, are sectors that are actually probably investing more and less\\ncautious, if you like. So this is the context. The reality is that, you're probably going to have to wait\\nfor some more months before really getting the confirmation that the market has rebounded for\\ngood.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nSo that's helpful, thank you and all the best.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nYou're welcome.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie, please go\\nahead.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nHi, thank you for the opportunity. Thierry, I just want to understand your organization look for global\\nbusiness lines. If I look at it, consulting is still separate. So I thought that, this is a good opportunity\\nto embed consulting more deeply and try to increase the cross-sell for that. Could you explain the\\nrational logic behind the reorg?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nOkay, all right. Ravi, so I'll try to, I have a one hour version of the answer, but I'll try to be concise.\\nSo back in late 2020, when we implemented our operating model with SMU and GBLs, we decided,\\nbecause this organization had never gone through a metric setup, we felt that it needed to be\\nextremely simple for it to be rapidly implementable.\\nAnd that's what we did. And that's why we went with two GBLs, iDEAS and iCORE. What possibly,\\nwe could not anticipate at that time is the speed of the growth we would experience in those two\\nGBLs in two years, 45% growth met those two GBLs, massively bigger than what we had\\nanticipated when we launched the model. In parallel, the level of maturity of our organization to\\nwork with SMUs and GBL working together in a very integrated model has dramatically progressed.\\nAnd finally, we have seen -- we have listened to our clients and we've seen a couple of things.\\nOne, the fact that we've done great in engineering and it was maybe time for engineering to just\\nfly on its own a little more. Because we have a fabulous potential at Wipro to really be a leader in\\nengineering even more.\\nSecond was the fact that more-and-more our clients were expecting from us that we come to them\\nwith a comprehensive cloud strategy addressing both infrastructure and applications without\\ndisassociating between those two different dimensions. And I think, we felt that by combining those\\ntwo components into what we call now a full stride cloud services would make us more impactful\\nand more competitive and more just able to better respond to their expectations.\\nThird, as you said, we've made acquisitions in consulting. We also had a consulting business and\\nby experience that consulting is, needs to be at the forefront of the market, so needs to be as close\\nas possible to the accounts and to the clients. They also need to be very closely connected to the\\nother GBLs because basically every global business line, every offering needs to work hands-inhands with our consultants. But at the same time, they need to be managed differently because\\nconsultants operate under different operating model and different ways of working. And I have a\\ndeep understanding of this business and it is clearly the objective was to create this platform, this\\nconsulting platform for the future of Wipro.\\nAnd finally, our fourth GBL is what we call Enterprise Futuring. It's actually combining different type\\nof businesses, DOP, data, and a digital experience that have as part of their evolution and\\napplications, obviously, the necessity to leverage artificial intelligence in everything they do. And\\nso those four GBLs have been put in place on April 1. It means that we are already in operation\\nunder this model for the last three months.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nAnd it's impressive. I'm going to share with you something. It's been working so smoothly, this new\\nmodel that I almost forgot to mention that we had just done it to the board few hours ago. It says\\na lot about how seamless this implementation has been and for sure, the intention is to increase\\nour impact in the market with our clients and at the same time, streamline our operations and\\nreduce the layers, if you like, between our teams operating and our clients.\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThank you for the detail, Thierry. And if I look at the kind of deals that you're announcing, it looks\\nlike you've actually started doing more complex deals and more, if I might call, outcome-oriented\\ndeals, where there is some risk transfer and you actually get paid for that transfer of risk along,\\nand that allows you to, I guess, make better margins than a simple list and shift.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nCompletely agreed, and this is exactly our strategy that we've laid out three years ago and we're\\nexecuting against that quarter-after-quarter.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThank you so much and best of luck.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nDipesh Mehta:\\n\\nYes, thanks for the opportunity. A couple of questions. First about if you can provide, Thierry, some\\nupdate about the Global Account Executive Program and empowerment, which you earlier\\nsuggested is the key focus area. So if you can give some update where we are in that journey?\\nSecond question is about the four service lines, which you said, if you can provide some update, I\\nthink, in terms of growth, how the traction is happening, which area is seeing more weakness\\ncompared to others? So if you can provide some sense about those four service lines?\\nLast question is for Jatin about EBIT margin aspirational. I think earlier we used to say, 17 is what\\nwe aspire to reach sooner. So if you can give some sense about how you expect that EBIT margin\\njourney to play out? Thank you.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nOkay, so I'm going to let Jatin address the questions three and then I'll come back for question\\none and two, okay?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes, so Dipesh, clearly, we had mentioned that 17, 17.5 is a medium-term outlook that we have\\nfor our business but in that ambition remains. We will continue to work towards that. However, we\\nneed to manage the short-term, and in the short-term, there is volatility in the market and\\nuncertainty in the revenue line, and that does impact our ability to drive the improvement that we\\nwant to drive.\\nI hope you appreciate that we have been able to deliver a very strong execution in quarter 1 that\\ndespite the volatility in revenue, we have delivered a flattish operating margin for quarter 1 and\\nthat journey and focus will continue to move towards that medium-term goal. It won't be an\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nimmediate outcome that one would be able to drive towards, but I think, we have the right building\\nblocks in place to move towards that goal. I will hand it over back to you.\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nYes. Jatin, thank you. So, the first question, the two questions, so the first one was around GAE\\nprogram. So as part of our strategy back in 2020, we decided that we would have a very accountfocused strategy. We would choose the industry we want to have a position in. We would choose\\nthe markets where we want to establish our position, grow and really invest long-term. And in these\\naccounts, we wanted to grow these accounts, not only in volume, but also in value. So in impact,\\nbasically. With the clear ambition to be not only an IT provider, but actually a true transformation\\npartner for our clients.\\nAs part of this ambition, we have decided to invest in two total account executives, those GAEs.\\nWe renamed it to really send a signal inside the team that, as a GAE, you are a total leader of the\\naccount you're managing. You're the CEO of the account you're running. You're representing\\nWipro for the account and we must all align behind you in your account strategy. Frankly, this has\\ntriggered, that this has fueled growth over the last three years. You know, I said a few minutes ago\\nthat, the number of USD100 million account has gone from 10 to 21 in the last 2.5 years. And I\\nthink, it's a reflection of that.\\nWe have now a lot more accounts of over USD 100 million, we have a lot more USD 15 million\\naccounts, and we continue this strategy. In fact, we reduce the tail of accounts to have less\\naccounts, but more impact in these accounts, we invest more. And as you said, we empower the\\nGAEs, the account executive, to really drive and have the possibility to make decisions, invest,\\nand grow those relationship, but also make sure that we are positioned as a true partner in those\\naccounts.\\nAnd finally, as part of this program, I mean, we've on-boarded a lot of talent. We have today a\\nsignificant diversity inside our organization and in particular in the account executive team as well\\nwhich is driving a lot of positive impact inside our organization every day beyond those accounts.\\nThe second point you had was the service lines. So the four service lines, the performance of the\\nfour service lines. Jatin, you want to say something?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nYes. So, Dipesh, as you know, we, like most of our competitors, we no longer publish the actual\\nfinancial performance of this four service line. But suffice to say that except for consulting where\\nwe have talked about the impact or a slower growth that we have seen, the rest of the service line\\ncontinue to perform very well and in line with the overall growth of the company.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal Oswal Financial\\nServices. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nYes, hi, thanks. Thierry, I just want to clarify regarding the billion dollar investments which you guys\\nhave announced in Gen AI. Can you give some sense on where the majority of this investment will\\nbe routed to? Is it something which you guys will primarily invest into tools which you will build out\\non using AI, or is this something where a big portion will kind of end up supporting employees who\\nare trained in that and hence the compositions will be higher than what you are currently kind of\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\ngiving, or is there something else where this investment will kind of be consumed given the\\nquantum of the number?\\nAnd second, Jatin, if you can just help us understand how to look at this investment, it will pass\\nthrough your balance sheet, through capitalization, or will you be expensing this out in income\\nstatement? And if it is an income statement item, can this be an incremental expenditure on top of\\nwhat you are currently doing?\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo, we have a very comprehensive plan, of course, behind the USD1 billion, Mukul. And it includes,\\nit's about investing into solutions, into assets, into accelerators, into capabilities, into methods, and\\nit's across the organization. It's also about training. There's a lot of aspects of these investments\\nand of course, as well, M&A. Jatin?\\n\\nJatin Dalal:\\n\\nAnd Mukul, I think just as Thierry described various streams of investment, I think, the accounting\\ntreatment will follow those streams for period cost, of course, that would be expensed, but large\\nprograms which could have future benefits to organizations over the years would be capitalized.\\nAnd of course, M&A would be accounted as per the merger and acquisition accounting policy.\\nSo it would follow the overall approach, but it is not incremental dollar spend in adding -- and all\\nthe expense lines will remain what they are as Thierry discussed or described earlier on this call.\\nThis would be funded through the gains on operations that we will make. So in that sense, it should\\nnot be seen or modeled as an incremental large P&L hit that you will take over the years?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nNo, it's absolutely. There's no, it's not outside of our margin profile for sure. I just want to add one\\nthing. I realized I forgot two things. It's also about investing in research, in platform. And also, that\\nwe have Wipro Ventures. Wipro Ventures carries today about two-third of the investments of Wipro\\nVentures are in the AI field. So, we'll continue because it's incredibly important as well to continue\\nto go after cutting edge startups through Wipro Ventures. Over to you, Mukul.\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nNo, great. I think that's helpful and thanks for the color. Thank you.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nYou're welcome.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I would now like to hand\\nthe conference back to Mr. Dipak Kumar Bohra for closing comments. Over to you, sir.\\n\\nDipak Kumar Bohra:\\n\\nYes. Thank you all for joining the call.

Our CFO, Aparna, and our\\nCOO Amit will join in with their comments as well.\\nQ2 was yet another quarter of strong deal booking for us. Total contract value terms, we closed\\nlarge deals to the tune of $1.3 billion. This is the highest in the last nine quarters and this represents\\n79% year-on-year growth and a 6% growth on quarter-on-quarter basis. During the quarter, we\\nbooked 14 deals in the greater than $30 million TCV range versus 10 in the previous quarter. Total\\nbookings from a TCV standpoint stand at $3.8 billion, which is also a growth of 6% year-on-year.\\nWe have added this quarter again one new account in the greater than $100 million client category\\nin Q2. We now have 22 accounts in that bucket. To remember, back in FY21, we had eleven $100\\nmillion accounts. So, we've doubled the number of accounts in the $100 million category. With one\\nor so two closes to half a billion dollar deals in two of our large accounts. As has been the case for\\nseveral quarters now, cash flow has remained strong at 145% of net income in Q2. EBIT or\\nearnings before tax and interest of our IT services segment has increased 6% year-on-year.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nAll of that gives us confidence that we're winning in the market against a backdrop of economic\\nweakness. The business environment as you all know has been uncertain. Inflation is at high as\\nhave interest rates. Clients are continuing to take a much more rigorous look at their investments.\\nThey are hyper-focused on efficiency, on optimization of existing investments and faster return on\\nnew ones. Lower discretionary spending is a reality today. Conversion of order book has become\\nslower. Transformation programs that are nearing the project term are being replaced by new\\nones, but at a slower pace. All of this has impacted our top line growth as well. In Q2, revenues\\ndeclined 2% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms. But even though there's some softness\\nin top line growth. We are continuing to hold margins steady. Operating margin for the first half of\\nFY24 was 16.1%. This is 110% basis points higher than our operating margin in the first half of\\nFY22.\\nNow, let's look at the performance of our four strategic market units. One in our Americas-I market\\nunit revenue grew 1% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms in Q2. This revenue growth\\nwas led by a strong performance in our healthcare business as well as in the technology products\\nand platforms business. Order bookings in terms of TCV grew 36% year-on-year.\\nOur Americas-II markets unit, which has higher exposure to consulting clients and to the BFSI\\nsector. Though a higher than usual impact of the macroeconomic slowdown, revenues in\\nAmericas-II declined 2.3% quarter-on-quarter in Q2.\\nEurope which has been our growth engine for the last two quarters for our last two years growing\\nby 39% in FY22 and 12% in FY23, has also seen slowing demand and reprioritization of client\\nspend, weighing on the overall business revenues in this market declined 5% quarter-on-quarter.\\nHaving said that, we are seeing strong traction on the order booking side, which in total contract\\nvalue terms increased 10% in Q2 year-on-year. Given our strong bookings in this market, we are\\nconfident of a swift rebound.\\nFinally, in our APNEA business, revenues for the quarter declined 0.5% quarter-over-quarter. Our\\ngoal in this region is absolutely to capture the rapidly digitizing market. For that, we are leveraging\\nour global scale and domain expertise to actually continue to move our portfolio towards higher\\nvalue transformation project. This focus on improving the quality of revenue is now reflecting in our\\nmargin performance, which has improved 330 basis points over the last five quarters. Being able\\nto sustain margin despite softer revenue is largely due to our ongoing transformation efforts. This\\nincludes several programs around delivery excellence and operational efficiencies. Across the\\nboard, we are pivoting our business towards high quality, high potential businesses and reducing\\nour loss-making accounts. We're also working on faster bench deployment. In the last quarter,\\ntalent utilization increased to 84.5%, an improvement of 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter.\\nThird, our segmentation strategy together with the one-way pro approach is helping us seal bigger\\ndeals with existing clients and win in a consolidating market. And I'm proud that we are seeing\\nthese benefits within three months of moving to the new four global business line operating model.\\nAmit will share more details shortly.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nBoth on the delivery assurance and efficiencies, these actions are having an immediate positive\\nimpact while also setting us up for long-term margin resilience, because profitable and sustainable\\ngrowth is our top priority.\\nIn Europe, we closed three large consolidation deals in Q2 at a 100% bid to win rate. For example,\\na global bank has selected Wipro as its partner to deliver multi-year digital transformation initiatives\\nacross business units. Wipro will work with the bank to build solutions to enhance its global\\nproducts and services through responsible use of AI and also hyper automation. This will deliver\\nbetter customer experience, analytics and drive significant operational efficiency.\\nAnother important point to drive your attention on. Our partnership strategy continues to stay\\nstrong. Booking through our partners as a percentage of total bookings have continued to increase\\nquarter-after-quarter, from 25% in FY22 to 44% in FY23, and it was at 53% in Q2.\\nIncreasingly, clients are not just looking to migrate to the cloud, but also run and grow their\\nbusinesses more efficiently on the cloud. Our full stride cloud services with its full stack cloud\\noffering is setting us apart from competition and letting us tap into opportunities across the cloud\\njourney. For example, multinational healthcare and insurance firms wants us to co-create the\\nconsumer and digital experience. As a strategic technology partner, we will build AI and automation\\nsolutions to drive speed to market, better client experience and reduce their cost. Our highperformance software engineering program will bring them at least 20% more efficiency.\\nNow, if you look at the bigger picture in this, you will see that our ongoing transformation is driving\\na substantial improvement in our market position and that's in turn reflected in the types of deals\\nwe are winning. Clients now look to us to help them solution and orchestrate their transformation.\\nThey trust us with their complex challenges. That's reflecting in the latest customer satisfaction\\nsurvey as well with our NPS expanding by 840 basis points, which is quite substantial.\\nI'll take a few minutes now to share an update on Wipro's AI 360 strategy. Since our announcement\\nlast quarter, we've trained as many as 180,000 employees in basic Gen AI general principles. We\\nhave rolled out personnel-based learning pathways to create a pool of specialized talent with\\ndeeper technical expertise. We are working with our alliance partners to further enhance AI\\nlearning pathways through our AI and cloud academies. Recently also, we launched a new GenAI\\nCenter of Excellence with IIT, Delhi. We're rapidly integrating GenAI into our processes, our\\nsolutions and our offerings. Thousands of our employees have or are starting to use GenAI. Let\\nme give you examples, in the HR functions, our teams are seeing significant productivity gains by\\nusing GenAI for candidate background verification. Then in marketing, we are using GenAI for\\ncontent generation and translation tasks that used to take hours earlier, now takes minutes. In\\nsales, we're deploying GenAI for research to improve sales collaboration and to generate\\nresponses. Knowledge engineering business. GenAI is helping with software development and\\nlifecycle automation. One of the areas with the biggest productivity gain is in quality engineering\\nand quality assurance testing. GenAI is helping with scenario creation, code generation, synthetic\\ndata creation as well as execution at scale. Initial pilots of these GenAI apps have been so\\nsuccessful that we are now rolling them out to our all our employees. On the clients’ front, GenAI\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nis now a part of every client conversation. There's a tremendous interest in exploring new use\\ncases as well as understanding the benefits and implications of this technology. Today, we are\\nseeing a doubling of GenAI active projects than we did just one quarter ago. For now, we're seeing\\nrapid adoption in healthcare, consumer and financial services, but also in hi tech and utilities.\\nOne example I can share with you here is the following: We are working with the US- based health\\ninsurer to deploy a GenAI-based chat bot for their agents. We are developing a solution that is\\nfine-tuned to be more contextual so that agents can provide more personalized assistance to every\\nmember. This solution is driving 30% to 40% reduction in operation costs, significant improvements\\nin agent productivity and improving net promoter scores.\\nAnother example, we're working with the European multinational telecom company to unlock value\\nfrom data. Working with different vendor tools and software kits, we are generating high quality\\nsynthetic data which allows the client to not only increase cross-border collaboration, but also\\nmitigate buyers and eliminate distribution limitations that exist in real data. As the technology\\nevolve and GenAI output becomes more accurate, we expect demand for our GenAI services and\\nexpertise to increase greatly over the next 6 to 12 months. Frankly, very excited by the opportunity\\nGenAI presents and we are investing in new use cases, solutioning for clients as well as upskilling\\nour employees because we really want to take a leadership position in this space.\\nOn our guidance now, for the next quarter we are guiding for a sequential growth of -3.5% to -1.5%\\nin constant currency terms. We expect margins to stay range bound as we've seen over the last\\nfew quarters. As the market starts to turn around on the back of our transformation and efficiency\\nplace, we expect to start seeing improvements in the coming quarters.\\nDespite the global slowdown across businesses, Wipro will continue to invest in its people through\\ntraining opportunities, leadership development, global exposure to new clients and technologies,\\nand by obviously also rewarding them with merit-based salary increases. Wipro's intellectual\\ncapital, our people are our biggest strength. We're continuing to strengthen our foundation,\\nstreamline our operations and moving towards a more modern dynamic culture. We have the right\\nstrategy and vision to keep us competitive and resilient. With that, I'll turn it over to Aparna for her\\ncomments. Thank you.\\nAparna Iyer:\\n\\nThank you, Thierry. Good evening to everyone who's joining us on the call today.\\nIn my update, I will quickly cover some key financial highlights for the quarter. To start with on the\\nrevenues, our IT services revenue for Q2 declined 2% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency\\nterms, which is at the lower end of the guided range for the quarter.\\nWe reported yet another quarter of healthy deal booking in total contract value terms. We closed\\nlarge deals to the tune of USD$1.3 billion, which is a 79% year-on-year growth. We also booked\\n14 deals which are greater than $30 million in TCV. Total bookings from a TCV standpoint stands\\nat US$3.8 billion, which grew 6% year-on-year.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nTurning to margins, our ongoing focus on operational improvement has ensured that the margin\\nremains steady even in a softening revenue environment. Our operating margins for the second\\nquarter were 16.1%, an expansion of 100 basis points year-on-year.\\nShifting to a cash flow performance, our operating cash flow for Q2 is at Rs.38.6 billion, which was\\n145% of our net income. Our free cash flow as a percentage of net income was at 149%. Cash\\nflow has been strong for the first half at 137% of net income. At the end of Q2, we had $4.1 billion\\nof gross cash and $2.2 billion of net cash on the balance sheet. Our net income attributable to the\\nshareholders for the quarter was at INR26.5 billion. Our EPS grew 4.1% year-on-year. Our\\neffective tax rate remained flat for Q2 at 24%. On the FOREX front, our realized rate for IT services\\nin Q2 was 82.54. Our DSO for the quarter is at 79 days, which is an improvement of three days\\nyear-on-year.\\nTo conclude, our guidance for the next quarter from IT services business segment is expected to\\nbe in the range of $2.617 billion to $2.672 billion. This translates to a sequential guidance of -3.5%\\nto -1.5% in constant currency terms. Thank you. And over to you, Amit.\\nAmit Choudhary:\\n\\nThank you, Aparna. Hello, everyone. I will share some updates on our business transformation\\nand how that's reflecting in our steady margin performance.\\nOur new four global business line model has allowed us to deliver a “One Wipro” service excellence\\napproach to our clients. It is reflected in our latest customer satisfaction survey with our NPS\\nexpanding by 840 basis points. This directly reflects our performance with clients, delivery,\\nprogram governance and our capabilities, and this is further strengthening our delivery-led sales.\\nOn the delivery excellence side, we have been very focused on consistency, efficiency and\\nproductivity for our clients. Automation and GenAI is a cornerstone here, with the corresponding\\nproductivity kicking in both on the delivery and functional sites.\\nOver the last quarter, on the operational efficiency front, utilization is now up to 84.5%. In fact,\\nutilization has increased by almost 470 basis points in the last four quarters, including utilization of\\nnext gen associates. We have taken several actions here from sustained bench reduction efforts,\\npyramid optimization to onshore, offshore rationalization and rigor around subcontracting costs.\\nAlongside, we are keeping a very close eye on discretionary spends with increased rigor on cost\\nand efficiency management.\\nThierry has talked about skill being our biggest currency. On the talent reskilling side, we continue\\nto scale Gen AI talent. Over 180,000 of our employees have taken the first GenAI course, focused\\nupskilling initiatives across skill families are in place now, including several account academies.\\nThese are collaborative initiatives with our clients providing a skilling road map for our teams to\\nserve them better. I am pleased with the progress we have made so far and a lot more lies ahead.\\nNow, I'll turn it back over to Dipak.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have our first\\nquestion from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nMy first question was around the large deal TCV. So, over the last four quarters, you have been\\nconsistently reporting 1 billion or more of large deal TCV. Over the last two quarters, your revenue\\nfrom existing customers have reached almost close to 100% about 99.6 or so number which was\\nabout 95, 96 sorts of a percent last year. Does that imply that large part of these deals which we\\nare seeing are renewal deals? I understand that you don't disclose those data, but this challenge\\nof high deal win not translating into revenue is not just unique to you, we have seen with other\\ncompanies as well, but at least their guidance or the commentary do suggest that in the coming\\nquarters they are going to see a much better growth outlook, whereas in contrast, your outlook\\nsuggests that the growth is going to further deaccelerate from hereon and it's absolutely in contrast\\nto the deal win TCV, which you're reporting. So is that a reflection that almost the entire part of the\\nlarge deal TCV which we are seeing here is actually a renewal and not meaningfully new deal\\nTCV.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nThis is not the case. I think you are certainly reflecting on the fact that indeed bookings in TCV\\nhave been very solid over the last quarter, that is true. What we are seeing is we are winning more\\nlarge deals. There's a good balance between new and renewals. Renewals can include increased\\nscope in the case of consolidation. So, we have different types of those large deals. I think you will\\nrecognize also what we've said because the market has not dramatically changed versus the\\nprevious last quarter is that while we win large deals that may take a little bit more time to convert\\ninto revenue. There's a lower volume of discretionary spend being clocked if you like with our\\nclients, that is the kind of now type of revenue that we are missing. The revenue trend you're seeing\\nis a reflection of those two different realities. On one side, there's a very decent volume of business\\nin the market. We have a strong pipeline and we are winning a nice share of these deals. We are\\nwinning more larger than before. Every quarter we improve. I mean, it's quite interesting. We've\\nmoved from occasionally a big one to now more systematically I would say win large deals this\\ntime to close to half a billion-dollar deal for the same quarter is a sign of that. And yet at the same\\ntime, discretionary spend is lower. You know that, like everybody in our industry, we have certain\\nvolume of our business that is more discretionary. We might be a little more exposed than some\\nothers because of our significant presence in consulting business in particular. And even if we\\nknow that it will be the first one to bounce back when the demand is there. So that's what we are\\nsaying. And now the last thing is accepting the fact we are guiding for the quarter to come and not\\nbeyond that and that's probably why That's how we are guiding to you. But we also believe that\\nshould the market remain as it is, we will slowly bounce back.\\n\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nMy second question was around your strategy of exiting from the smaller accounts and we started\\nseeing the effect of that from last year's fourth quarter and since then the revenue for the IT\\nservices has come down by about $90 million. It appears to be that proactively pruning small\\naccounts at a time when the demand environment could be counterproductive and actually could\\nbe one of the reasons why our growth could be getting impacted.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nFirst of all, our strategy that we elaborated back in 2020 was to clearly get a lot of large accounts.\\nWe had at that time 11 accounts over 100 million, which was clearly lower than most in the\\nindustries, companies of similar size. You cannot invest unilaterally across the board. You have to\\nmake choices. And that makes a lot more sense to invest into partnership relationship with clients\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nthat will allow you to drive significant growth, there's a potential of significant growth. And that's\\nwhat we've done. The cost of sales for very small account is higher. It is proven. We know that\\nuntil a certain point in time you are spending an abnormal amount of time to close very small deals\\nand not so much more time to close bigger deals. So that's a conscious decision to focus on less\\nnumber of accounts, but be meaningful as a partner in these accounts, be their partner in the\\ntransformation and that's what we've done. So, I give you two data points, Kumar Rakesh; one,\\nlook at the top accounts of over 100 million. We've doubled the number of these accounts in two\\nyears from 11 to 22, as simple as that. Second thing, if you look at what we call our middle account,\\nwhich are our top 80 accounts, they've actually resisted a lot better than the smaller ones. I think\\nit's just the confirmation that this is the right strategy. We need to continue to focus our attention\\non those accounts where there will be growth over the next quarters, but also accounts that are\\nshaping our industry and reduce the wasted investments in accounts where we will never go\\nbeyond a certain point.\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nThe rationale behind the strategy is very well appreciated. My question was more around the timing\\nof that strategy to bring into effect in full effect. Can that also be contributing or pulling down our\\nrevenue?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo, let me address this point also. What have we done in terms of growth strategy over the last\\nthree years, in the first two years has been a period of significant growth, there was significant\\ngrowth in this market. We've gone all in, and we have really got a good share of the growth. If you\\nlook at the growth during that time, company has changed in scale, right. Over 40% increase in\\nsize in 10 quarters, market has changed. I think you will recognize that with me the market is\\ndifferent. There's more macro instability, uncertainty, cautiousness, everything. So, you know this\\nis not a growth market right now. Let's face it, right. And so I think we recognized that this is not\\nnecessarily a market where anybody will shine in terms of growth. For us, what's key is to continue\\nour focus on our transformation; continue to be more relevant, continue to drive our investment\\npriorities around AI, around cloud, around security; continue to upgrade our talent; continue to be\\nmore nimble, more efficient and that's how we are, you will recognize that's how we continue to\\nmaintain and actually deliver the level of margins we are at in Q2. And so that's we are ready for\\nwhen the market will bounce back to go back into growth mode.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nSo, my first question is regarding initiatives taken by us to broaden our funnel to include mega\\ndeals which are like $500 million plus kind of a TCV in pipeline and pursue the same. And related\\nquestions are also around the nature of bookings that we have had. Are they more on the cost\\nside or more on the transformation side? Have we made any tweaks in strategy to pivot to the\\nchanged market conditions when deals are coming more towards the cost optimization side?\\nThank you.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nGood question. Go off. So, I'll take a shot at those two upon. I feel free to jump in or I mean if you\\nfeel like it. So, on the first point, which is the focus on the larger deals, I think it was clear that back\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\na few years ago, we were not getting our fair share of larger deals and you know, large deals are\\ngiving you a certain level of resilience and also a certain level of impact with the client and that is\\ncompletely in the center of our strategy to develop as I said. Before to develop, you know strategic\\nrelation and meaningful relation with our clients. So, to do so, with our CGO, Stephanie, we've\\nstarted to build our larger team, right, it started with bringing talent, people that have been that are\\nbig dealers that have been building larger teams in the past. We've also obviously refocused our\\naccount executives and our leaders to be ready to go for larger deals. It has positioned us to\\nengage at a different level with our clients. Let's pay more attention to their priorities and challenges\\nand be proactive in bringing back to them solutions that would address the challenges. And we've\\nstarted to win larger deals. It started with one big one and then another big one, but it was more\\nerratic at the beginning and then we started to win more of these large deals and larger ones in\\nsize. And I think it's becoming the machine now inside Wipro, where you know as part of our deals,\\nwe have a significant volume of large deals every quarter and I think we expect this to continue\\nover the next quarters, so that form the large deals. On the cost actions you ask or have, if I\\nunderstood well your question was how did you balance focus on?\\nAparna Iyer:\\n\\nHe wants to understand whether the pipeline, the deals that you are winning….\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo, yes, that is, I would grab on the pipeline, I would say there is certainly an evolution of the type\\nof deals that we are seeing and the attention to cost takeout, cost optimization, margin productivity\\nand so on is certainly a lot bigger than it was some quarters ago. There is no doubt.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nDipesh Mehta:\\n\\nCouple of questions. First, about sales and marketing increase. This quarter, it is showing some\\nspike percentage of revenue. There is a good uptake Q-o-Q, Y-o-Y. If you can help us understand\\nwhat drives these significant of expression in sales and marketing. The related question is if I look\\nnumber of new clients which we had every quarter, it is showing moderation for last few quarters.\\nSo, these two numbers are not matching with directionally, if you can provide some sense. Second\\nquestion is about if I look reconciliation item, earlier we indicated some correction is driving that\\nitem. Now this quarter again it is increased. So, 2.2 billion loss in the line item. How we should\\nunderstand this line item and how would you expect it to trend in the coming quarter? Thank you.\\n\\nAparna Iyer:\\n\\nSo, Dipesh, to your point on sales and marketing expenses being high, it's specifically in reference\\nto one of the line items on depreciation amortization where we have taken an accelerated\\namortization pertaining to one of our customer intangibles and that is why it's a one-off and it should\\nnormalize over a period of time. The second piece that you said on the number of accounts being\\nmoderated, you know Thierry just answered that it is a part of the strategy, we are focusing on\\nincreasing and expanding our top client relationships and it is in line with what we are pursuing as\\na strategy overall. To your third question that you had asked on the reconciling items, last quarter\\nthat is in Q1 of this fiscal, we had announced that knowing to a turn in the macroeconomic\\nenvironment and for us in line with all the transformation that we are pursuing, we wanted to be\\nmore agile and we had announced a restructuring program under which we had taken in\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"wipro.com\\n\\nrestructuring expenses both in Q1 and we've indicated that there would be a spill over into Q2,\\nwhich has been now booked in the reconciling items. This is towards the employee severance\\ncosts and is one-off in nature and that is how you should model it.\\nDipesh Mehta:\\n\\nSo, is it now over from Q3 onwards this line item will not be there, or you expect it to recur?\\n\\nAparna Iyer:\\n\\nSo, we're not calling out for any particular guidance on this. We had said that it was one-off in\\nnature. We will need to take into account what is shifting and what's changing in our business. If\\nthere is more update, we will share it with you in the next quarter.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Abhishek Kumar from JM Financial. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nThierry, you mentioned that you expect in next couple of quarters things to look up. I was just\\nwondering what is driving your confidence. Are we seeing that the runoff of discretionary projects\\nthat we have witnessed over the last couple of quarters, is that coming to an end or you expect\\ngeneral demand to improve further?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nAbhishek, thanks for your question. I'll try to address it by staying within our policy in terms of\\nguidance. So, one is certainly the guidance for Q3 includes a certain volume of our furloughs, let's\\nbe clear, bigger than it was the previous year, right. It's a fact which we don't necessarily expect\\nto repeat for sure. Second is the fact that quarter after quarter with our level of TCV, we continue\\nto build the backlog of deals. So, there's a bigger proportion of our revenue that gets covered by\\ncontract if you like for the quarters to come. So, we are staying certainly cautious and as you know,\\nwe are not guiding beyond this quarter, but it feels that we can reasonably expect a rebound to\\ncome after.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nSure, that's helpful. Just one follow-up maybe. So, on order backlog you mentioned, so while you\\nknow we are winning deals, so inflow is good, at the same time there is depletion of current book\\nof business. So, I know we don't give that number, but any color in terms of how the order backlog\\nhas improved over the past few quarters, given these two movements in different directions. Thank\\nyou.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nWell, you know Abhishek, one, the type of deals includes a bigger proportion of larger deals than\\nbefore, which will trigger a bigger stickiness in these accounts going forward, no doubt. Second,\\nthe very nature of those larger deals tends to be more strategic. So, the type of deals looking at\\nour portfolio, we've done a lot of work over the last quarters to continue the rotation of our portfolio,\\nmarket synergy based around data, around security, around cloud and engineering and this is\\nwhat's happening. So, I would say the nature of these deals has certainly continued to evolve.\\nThere's a greater attention to cost rationalization. Therefore, producing business case, delivering\\noutcomes, those are typically what we are seeing in the deals that we are closing, and I would say\\nalso we are seeing good volume of deals of clients working on the consolidation of their providers\\nwhere we are seeing opportunities to expand our position in these accounts.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We have our next question from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang Equities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nThierry, how would you characterize the mood of clients, would you say they seem more optimistic\\nor pessimistic today compared to say when you interact with them three months back or six months\\nback? That's question number one.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nIf I understood well, Girish, you asked me to characterize the mood of the market of the clients?\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nMood of the clients, right?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo, it's an interesting question, Girish. It is every day I speak to clients, right. So, for sure, I try to\\ngauge their mood and their priorities and so on. What do I see? First of all, technology is in lot of\\ntheir priorities. They are very mature about technology. They have a lot of ambition about how\\ntechnology will transform their business. They're very curious about how AI and GenAI is either\\nimpacting or transforming or helping them be more efficient in their industry, and a lot of those\\ndiscussions are around that. There is a certain level of cautiousness to engage in a new program.\\nThere is a certain level of cautiousness to spend as much as what they used to spend in the\\nprevious quarter or in the previous years. So, they are like you and me. So, they are reading the\\nnewspaper every day. They see the news on the American economy, European economy, the war,\\nhere and there, and the fact that all of this is creating a certain level of instability and anxiety. A lot\\nof people are starting to project themselves and say, okay, it's going to be time to resume some of\\nthose programs because the business will obviously suffer from less attention to technology. So,\\nthat's the mood, I would say is in a way cautious and anxious, but at the same time very aware of\\nthe fact that it's going to be time to resume those investments sooner than later. Over to you.\\n\\nGirish Pai:\\n\\nRegarding your remarks that you made, a lot of comments on Generative AI. In your operations,\\nto what extent are you using Generative AI today and where are you on that journey and where do\\nyou think maybe like 12 months down the road and what are the kind of productivity gains you had\\nand connected with that are the clients you mentioned that lot of the conversations around\\nGenerative AI, are they actually asking for? Regarding generative AI if you can give some more\\nexplanation?\\n\\nSubha Tatavarti:\\n\\nThis is Subha Tatavarti. I'm the CTO. We heard parts of your question and I want to kind of address\\nsome parts of it. One was around what is our strategy. We believe that Generative AI will\\nfundamentally change many businesses and also the way we live. So, we have been very, very\\naggressive and in the last six months we have adopted Generative AI to streamline our technology\\nbusiness processes as well as people. And this is very, very early, but early signs are indicative of\\nproductivity gains and in many areas, we talked a little bit about in the HR space, specifically\\naround background checks, a lot of work we do is around employee hiring, retention training and\\nmanaging. So, a lot of our work is now being streamlined, at least in early parts of our work with\\nGenerative AI in this space are very positive and encouraging in terms of productivity gains.\\nSimilarly on the quality assurance and testing practice, this has been quite interesting because in\\nthe last 2 to 3 months, the kind of highlights we've ran are indicative that we can significantly\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We have our next question from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nIf I just look at the third quarter guidance and look at the first 9 months of this financial year, it's\\nlikely to be a 4% decline on a Y-o-Y basis in constant currency terms, which would be one of the\\nlowest in the industry and this would be a second period in a row where our growth on organic\\nbasis would be actually lower than the industry. So, Thierry, my question is do we need to\\nintrospect our growth strategy, our offerings, do you believe is there any gap in the offerings or is\\nit we have to actually check and introspect our go-to-market model because deal wins are one\\nindicator which everybody is winning but our growth rates have been lagging quarter after quarter\\nand period after period starting from FY22 on organic business?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo, Sandeep, we are very clearly at Wipro on the way we want to progress, we have our own\\njourney. We are to define our own strategy and we have our own ambition and our own focus.\\nOver the quarters, there have been quarters where we've grown a little more, some of them we've\\ngrown less and that's a reality. What matters is to look at the progression over the certain period\\nof time and look at what we've done over the last years, and I think you'll have a response in terms\\nof our growth strategy. The growth that this organization, this leadership team has been able to\\ndrive over the last 3 years is actually a pretty decent level of growth. We always want more growth,\\ntrust me, Sandeep, but at the same time we are focusing on our transformation as much as we are\\nfocusing on the day-to-day performance and that's incredibly important. You need to reflect and\\nunderstand that. The way we have redefined our ambition, the way we have invested in our\\norganization, in talent, in capabilities, in solutions, the way we've invested in our systems, the way\\nwe have invested in consulting capability is to reposition ourselves in our operating model, in our\\nown efficiency, all of that is to be taken into account and you cannot take only one element of the\\nperformance in isolation of the rest. That's how we are looking at our progression. We are happy\\nwith where we are for sure. We're always trying to do more, and we are always ambitious to do\\nmore, but we are looking ahead of us, quite confident at our opportunity to get back into growth as\\nthe market gets a little better frankly.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nAnd just a related question, when you expect a pickup in the growth and rebound in the growth, is\\nit fair to assume that fourth quarter onwards the guidance may not indicate any kind of a Q-on-Q\\ndip? Are you indicating a rebound from 4Q or maybe 1Q of the next financial year?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nNo, Sandeep, no, you will not get anything more from me.

We've done very well on remaining resilient in the first half. The\\nefficiency measures have only intensified. It will be a challenging task, that's why we've said that\\nour endeavor will be to be range bound in terms of what we've delivered over the last few quarters,\\nbut I agree with you that there are more headwinds as we start the quarter.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThierry, you mentioned about your win rates in the last years in Europe being 100%. Could you\\ncomment a bit on how that changed in the US over the last few years?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nYou specifically to Europe, Ravi, correct?\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nSpecifically, to US, Thierry.\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nSo, I would say, well, we do not have a 100% score in your US, it doesn't mean it's a bad score. I\\nthink we've done very well in the US as well. We just highlighted the 100% score in Europe because\\nwe consider that this is quite a performance, but the performance, the win rate is actually improving\\nand strong in the US, like it is in in Europe or actually in Asia PAC, Ravi.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nSo, overall, you would say that you've seen win rates improved and your pipeline as well and that's\\nwhy we're seeing the deal TCV, right overall….\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nWhat we are seeing is that we are getting better at qualifying the deals that we see in the pipeline\\nto reduce the lost investments, if you like. And so, it is definitely delivering results. There's no doubt\\nthat when we have gone through the qualification process and feel that this is a deal that we can\\nwin, then the entire mobilization of the team is here to drive it till the finish line.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThank you. One last follow-up on Europe. We saw a surprising decline here, any specific industry\\nor country that was responsible largely for this?\\n\\nThierry Delaporte:\\n\\nYes, you're right. It is a surprising decline for Europe. I can imagine for you given the way we held\\npretty strongly the previous quarter, I think I'm looking at Aparna just, but to me this is financial\\nservices primarily and manufacturing, so two sectors, no, I mean we haven't lost any account or\\nit's not like we've had a drama but certainly some significant slowdown noticed in some of our large\\naccounting in financial services and manufacturing in Europe. Having said that, that's what Ravi,\\nif I can just add one element. Pipeline continues to be strong in Europe. The leadership team in\\nEurope is pretty bullish. So, it gives confidence that Europe will bounce back rapidly.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Our US dollar\\nrevenue crossed the 7 billion mark in Q3 and revenues grew 19.1% in rupee\\nterms, 13.5% in constant currency terms, and 8.4% in dollar terms.\\nOur operating margin for the quarter was 24.5%, an expansion of 0.5%\\nsequentially. Our net margin came in at 18.6%.\\nI'm very happy to share that the board has announced a dividend of `75 per\\nshare, including a special dividend of `67 per share. Including the interim\\ndividends paid out in the first half of the year, this translates into a shareholder\\npayout of `33,297 crore for year-till-date.\\nI will now invite Samir, Milind and NGS to go over different aspects of our\\nperformance during the quarter. I'll step in again later to provide some more\\ncolor on the demand trends that we're seeing. Over to you, Samir.\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nThank you Rajesh. Let me first walk you through the headline numbers.\\nIn the third quarter of FY'23 our revenues grew 13.5% year-on-year on a\\nconstant currency basis. Reported revenue in INR was `582.29 billion, an\\nyear-on-year growth of 19.1%. In dollar terms, our revenue was $7.075 billion,\\nan year-on-year growth of 8.4%.\\nMoving to the operating margin, we had 70 basis points benefit from the\\ncurrency movement. Operational rigor including utilization, reduced use of\\nsubcontractors, resulted in a net benefit of 0.3% or 30 basis points, offset by\\n50 basis points headwind from higher third-party expenses and increasing cost\\nof return to normalcy. Overall, our operating margin expanded 50 basis points\\nsequentially to 24.5%.\\nNet income margin was 18.6% impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations.\\nThe effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%.

You might recall that our approach to overcoming the supply\\nside challenges faced by the industry was to bring in fresh talent at scale, and\\nthen train them on new technologies.\\nIn the prior six quarters, we onboarded 135,000 fresh engineers. In Q3 alone,\\nwe brought on about another 7,000 fresh engineers amounting to a total of\\n42,000 freshers year-to-date. These are unprecedented numbers.\\nOur biggest strength has been nearly 125,000 TCS at middle and senior levels,\\nwho have been with the company for over 10 years on average. They have\\nbeen central to our ability to culturally and operationally integrate all the fresh\\ntalent we brought onboard and ensuring that the project outcomes and\\ncustomer experiences continue to be the best-in-class.\\nLast year, our net hiring was significantly ahead of our revenue growth. Our\\nfocus this year has been on utilizing all that excess capacity and making our\\nnewest employees productive. Between that and elevated attrition, we had a\\nnet reduction of headcount and our workforce strength as of December 31 st\\nstood at 613,974. We continue to have a very diverse workforce with 153\\nnationalities represented and with women making up 35.7% of the base.\\nOn the learning front, TCSers clocked 11.4 million learning hours in Q3,\\nresulting in an acquisition of 1.3 million competencies. LTM attrition in IT\\nservices was at 21.3%, slightly down quarter-on-quarter but still very elevated\\nas it reflects the high levels of churn in the prior quarters.

As mentioned by NGS, the seasonality led to some\\nmoderation in growth in verticals like BFSI, Retail and Technology and\\nServices and across all our key markets. While the seasonal aspect should\\nreverse in the next quarter, the macroeconomic uncertainties are likely to result\\nin a more balanced year in 2023 after two years of strong growth.\\nFor now we see a client caution translating into greater focus on cost\\noptimization. We're seeing an increase in the number of large operating model\\ntransformation engagement. In the first three quarters of FY'23, we won 20\\nsuch deals versus 16 in the prior year same period. Our innovative approach\\nto redesigning the operations and embedding AI and intelligent automation into\\nindividual processes using TCS Cognix™ has been delivering superior\\noutcomes for our clients and differentiated positioning for TCS.\\nWe are also seeing an uptick in vendor consolidation. Our scale, full services\\ncapability and track record of delivering outsized savings through operating\\nmodel transformation is helping us win such deals. We have won quite a few\\nsuch deals across BFSI healthcare, manufacturing and telecom and we see\\nmany more in the pipeline.\\nHere is a good illustration: The BT Group, UK's leading provider of fixed and\\nmobile telecommunication, announced a new partnership with TCS for its\\ndigital unit to boost its modernization plans. TCS will manage and ramp down\\nover 70% of digital legacy technology estate, and boost capacity to accelerate\\nthe build of its new strategic technology architecture, supporting the group's\\ngrowth.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 6 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Our strategic industry-specific solution fabrics\\nbuilt on market leading hyper scalar platforms accelerate enterprise digital\\ntransformation and drive exponential business value through industry\\ninnovation.\\nWe won several new cloud transformation deals in Q3. Here are a few\\nexamples.\\nWe were selected by Boston Scientific Corporation, a global medical devices\\ncompany as a strategic partner for their purpose-led, enterprise-wide multicloud acceleration program. TCS' decade-long transformative partnership will\\nhelp deliver cloud-native resilient and futuristic operations that will fuel Boston\\nScientific's global business growth and its mission of transforming lives through\\ninnovative medical solutions.\\nTCS expanded its partnership with the UK headquartered international savings\\nand investment firm to help them transform into a cloud-only organization by\\n2025, through a series of technology and business transformation initiatives.\\nLeveraging its deep contextual knowledge of the client's IT and business\\nlandscape, TCS will help modernize and transform their application estate\\nusing cloud-native architecture, and seamlessly migrate them to a public cloud\\nusing TCS Cloud Counsel and TCS Migration Factory.

Predictive analytics, machine\\nlearning and AI are fueling such innovation.\\nLet me illustrate with three examples. PostNord, a European communications\\nand logistics solution provider has partnered with TCS to achieve their `Win in\\nParcels’ key strategic priority and to be the market leader. Their key objective\\nis to transport more parcels per truck in each trip made between the terminals\\nand their regional hubs.\\nTCS developed a touchless AI-based solution using machine vision and\\nimportantly, existing security CCTV cameras, to accurately measure the truck\\nfill rate in real-time. It leverages a TCS proprietary algorithm to optimize the\\nline haul planning and truck departures. This has helped improve the revenue\\nyield per truck, reducing the number of trips and associated costs, and even\\nthe carbon footprint.\\nTCS partnered a US headquartered multinational biopharmaceutical company\\nin co-creating and implementing an industry-first AI-based solution to transform\\nthe handling of patient complaints about drug-device combination products,\\nsuch as pre-filled injections and auto injectors.\\nThe solution triages complaints and automatically separates out productrelated complaints from drug-related adverse events, resulting in faster\\nprocessing of complaints, timely feedback to patients and to internal design\\nand production teams for remediation. This has helped improve product\\nquality, enhance patient experience and contributed to improved sales of such\\ncombination products.\\nToyota Material Handling in North America engaged TCS to transform its field\\nservice teams’ ability to diagnose and repair. TCS’ solution enables guided\\ntroubleshooting, self-service and cognitive search of technical product support\\ncontent using AI/ML and NLP, which helps reduce downtime associated with\\nunplanned maintenance by 10% to 15%.

They\\nhave been entrusting us with these integration or divestiture mandates on\\naccount of our contextual knowledge of the business and IT landscapes, our\\nhighly collaborative inside-out approach to transformation, and proprietary\\naccelerators such as TCS Crystallus™, a set of pre-configured industry and\\nbusiness solutions available on leading enterprise application platforms. Here\\nare three examples:\\nPhilips Domestic Appliances, a carve-out from Royal Philips and a global\\nleader in kitchen coffee, garment care and home care appliances, engaged\\nTCS as a sole-sourced primary partner to support PDS’ transition to an\\nindependent entity, and its business transformation to become a digital-first\\nand consumer-centric organization.\\nTCS established a digital core for the new business, designed lean business\\nprocesses and successfully rolled out the pilot in seven countries. We are now\\nworking towards a big bang go-live for the rest of the world. This is expected\\nto be the foundation for a 10x growth in sales from expansion into new markets\\nand channels, with 20 million highly engaged customers.\\nSimilarly, we are helping a leading North American bank with the seamless\\nmerger of a US bank. TCS' deep contextual knowledge and platform expertise\\nwas critical for success in this large and complex M&A program, involving\\nonline banking channels, treasury and payment services, auto and equipment\\nfinancing, among others.\\nTCS did an end-to-end mapping of the products and processes of the acquired\\nbank and carried out a parity uplift to ensure consistent experience for\\nincoming acquired bank customers. At the back end, we integrated new\\nlending and leasing products into the acquirer bank's portfolio and migrated the\\nacquired bank’s products, customers and users to the acquirer’s platforms.\\nWith the successful integration, the acquirer bank expanded into a large\\ncomplementary contiguous market in the US, doubling its branch footprint and\\nonboarded over 1.5 million new customers and inherited a strong commercial\\nbusiness with a high-quality loan portfolio.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 9 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

TCS\\nis responsible for end-to-end integration of warehouses and factories. It will set\\nup a transformation management office to enable faster realization of\\nsynergies, and serve as the foundation for future M&A.\\nLet me now provide a few examples of TCS partnering with clients to use digital\\ntechnologies to help launch innovative new products or services that drive new\\nrevenue streams.\\nA leading US-headquartered media and technology multinational partnered\\nwith TCS for building a single digital ecosystem platform, spanning home\\nentertainment and mobility. As the sole strategic partner, TCS was responsible\\nfor the full lifecycle of the new technology platform for this new line.\\nTCS designed and implemented the solution through an API grid for the entire\\necosystem leveraging AI/ML for agile operations, proactive care, proactive\\nservice management, and preventive fault management. The new business\\nmodel helped deliver truly personalized and unique customer experiences to\\nend-customers. It recently crossed 5 million customer connection and\\nwitnessed high NPS score and customer satisfaction ratings.\\nTCS helped a leading US money transfer service provider transform its\\ntechnology estate into modern cloud-powered platform, enabling it to launch\\nnew products faster, expand into new markets and strengthen its customer\\nrelationships.\\nLeveraging the new integrated next-generation multi-currency digital wallet\\nand digital banking platform, our clients have forayed into digital banking in\\nEurope, offering customers access to a variety of differentiated multicurrency\\npayment services in a single app. The new platform has also helped the client\\nsuccessfully integrate with cross-industry ecosystem partners to offer millions\\nof customers greater ease, reliability and access to money movement, and\\npayment service capabilities. Overall, the transformation has resulted in\\nincreased customer loyalty, reduced customer journey barriers and created\\nnew revenue streams.\\nSimilarly, in Q3, an APAC-based automotive electronics manufacturer chose\\nTCS as their co-innovation partner in developing a next-gen instrument panel\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 10 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

TCS services will span product development, HMI or Human Machine\\nInterface, functional safety, cyber security and other cockpit related products.\\nIn prior calls, I have given examples of how TCS is participating in large\\nindustry transformation initiatives. In the Utilities sector, we have had several\\nexamples of TCS helping utilities or power producers navigate energy\\ntransition. Our domain expertise and track record in executing successful\\ntransformations is firmly establishing us as the preferred G&T partner in the\\nsector. Here’s one more example of the same.\\nWestern Power, a leading Australian power generator and distributor, selected\\nTCS for our credentials in this space to design, deliver and support a\\ndistribution system operator platform solution. Our solution enables the client\\nto orchestrate Distributed Energy Resources or DERs, such as rooftop solar\\nbatteries and large appliances across homes and businesses into a virtual\\npower plant, aggregating the excess electricity generated by their assets and\\nthen dispatching it into what will become new energy markets and services.\\nTCS’ solution also addresses critical issues like low voltage network visibility\\nand optimization.\\nWith over 650 participating customer energy assets till date, the platform has\\ndemonstrated the safety and reliability of aggregated DERs and helped the\\nclient model the complexity of bi-directional energy flows. This will open doors\\nfor Western Power to participate in the futuristic energy market and build new\\nrevenue streams while safely operating within the technical limits of the\\ndistribution grid.\\nLikewise, we're participating in the longer-term transformation trends in the\\ntransportation sector. Last year, I had spoken about the work we're doing for\\nTransport of London to transform the administration of taxis and private hire\\nvehicles in London to prepare it for an electric and autonomous future. In Q3,\\nwe won a deal that will transform the railways sector in the UK.\\nTCS was chosen by the Rail Delivery Group, UK's leading rail industry\\nmembership body for the creation of a rail data marketplace. TCS will leverage\\ndata syndication, monetization and marketplace features of its DeXAM\\nplatform and a leading hyper scalar cloud to combine fragmented sources of\\nrail data into one digital service.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 11 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

By vertical, BFSI\\nhad a TCV of $2.5 billion while retail order book stood at $1.2 billion. The TCV\\nof deal signed in North America stood at $4.2 billion.\\nWith that, we will open the line for questions.\\nModerator:\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.\\nThe first question comes from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nMy first question was to better understand the headcount moderation during\\nthe quarter. During the press conference, Rajesh, you talked about the focus\\non headcount efficiency to continue in the fourth quarter as well. Assuming the\\nheadcount stay steady in 4Q, you will be exiting the year with a headcount\\ngrowth of about 4% YoY. My question was, is that an indication of growth\\nvisibility that you have today and hence the rationalization or you are confident\\nof driving similar or higher productivity gains, and hence revenue growth could\\nbe significantly higher than that?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nI think the best way to think about it is that on a year-on-year basis, our net\\nheadcount is higher. So, we have significantly invested in building up capacity\\nfrom 2021, tried as much as possible to bypass the industry's hire-from-eachother attrition cycle, and focus on hiring at entry level, and invested in training\\nand cross training our resources. That investment has hit our productive\\ncapacity and stood us in good stead. The incremental hiring for this year should\\nbe seen in context of what we've done in the last year also. Overall, we are\\nvery comfortable with where we are with our net headcount. We hired\\nsignificantly ahead of revenue growth in '21 and balanced it with a more\\nprudent hiring in calendar '22.\\nGoing forward, we should be back to a more normal kind of hiring trend. While\\nspecific numbers will keep evolving, we should expect hiring in the range of\\n125,000 to 150,000 for the year, offset by more normalized attrition levels\\ncloser to our long-term averages, which will give us sufficient capacity to take\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 12 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And then we can keep bringing in shorter term hiring to take\\ncare of demand as it unfolds. So, that would be the best way to think about and\\nmodel it.\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nMy second question was on the deal side. So, you talked about that cost\\noptimization deals have already started picking up meaningfully. In the past,\\nduring recessions, we have noticed that first, there's a sharp cut to IT budget,\\nbefore cost optimization deals starts picking up. I understand that visibility on\\nclient budgets is still a couple of months away. But do you think this time the\\ntransition from discretionary IT spending to cost optimization deals could be far\\nsmoother than what we have seen in earlier recession period?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nIt's also a factor of how it is playing out in different markets. So, as I said, if we\\ntake a market like UK, that is well and truly into much more strategic long term,\\ncost-based restructuring kind of deals. We're seeing multiple such ones play\\nout and we're participating very strongly in that.\\nMarkets like US, we need to wait and watch how that will play in the next couple\\nof quarters, but we are fairly constructive. Our conversations with customers\\nare much more balanced ones where they are equally positive, as well as\\ncautious and we should see a mix of both cost and transformation deals.\\nIn Europe, decision making is slow. So, it's very difficult to call it one way or\\nthe other. So, this is not some major single event that has happened globally.\\nAll three markets are moving to three different beats and each of them is\\nindexed to their own specific outlooks.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nRajesh, I just wanted to basically pick your brain on the performance of the\\nretail segment in this quarter. This segment has outperformed the company\\naverage growth rate and also doing really very well. Globally, we are hearing\\nabout a lot of these retail chains, calling out weakness, especially in Europe in\\nparts as well. So, any color on that would be helpful as to what drove this strong\\nperformance in this quarter, do you expect this to sustain in the coming\\nquarters also? And also, is there some color to it in terms of let's say, US retail\\nmaybe doing slightly better than Europe retail, as you just called out that in\\nEurope, the decision making is slow on an overall basis?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 13 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

So, that's the industry group that we report on. Within\\nthat, if you look at it, travel and hospitality is enjoying a very strong rebound\\nafter a couple of very, very challenging years. And we are one of the largest, if\\nnot the largest, service provider in that industry and we were significantly\\nimpacted in the last couple of years and also we are now participating and also\\nwinning quite reasonably.\\nCPG sector going through multiple forms of transformation, mostly led in\\nvarious forms of direct-to-customer channel strategy transformation, and\\nsignificant investments going into that. Also, analytics, sustainability, direct-tocustomer, each of these themes are continuing to find a lot of traction and\\ncontinued investment, and we are participating in all three quite well.\\nRetail itself is more regional, and different markets have different focus. Plus,\\nwithin retail, grocery as a segment continues to do well. More discretionary\\nretail is, as I said, market specific.\\nGoing to the last part of your question, US retail sales adjusted for inflation\\nitself, have still come in stronger than last year and last year was a very strong\\nyear. So, overall, from a volume perspective, retail in the US has done well.\\nHowever, profitability has been challenged, both by customers walking down\\nthe product line in terms of preferring a slightly cheaper products on a relative\\nbasis, as well as the fact that cost structures have been up. We need to wait\\nand see how this will be translated. But some of those costs are transient, some\\nof them will require more structural cost transformation deals.\\nSo, it's a fairly complex set of drivers in there. It goes back to what we always\\nsaid, we stay close to the customer, and we play each customer and each\\nscenario on a one-on-one basis.\\nOverall, we believe that the industry continues to be very attractive. And we\\nhave the full suite of capabilities to be participating across this broad spectrum,\\nand to make sure that we stay relevant to customers on a very individualized\\nbasis.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nSince you touched upon the travel and hospitality segment, as you mentioned\\nthat we bore the brunt of it while COVID struck and the segment was down and\\nnow we're seeing a strong rebound in this segment. I think globally also we are\\nseeing very strong bookings in Greece and Spain and baggage can also come\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 14 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

So, do you expect this momentum to maybe continue in the travel segment\\nin the coming quarters as well? Of course, this is assuming no more waves\\nand no more lockdowns and everything. But do you think you expect this\\nmomentum to continue in this segment in the next couple of quarters given that\\nthese clients would now probably start spending more on to it?\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nI think so. The caveat, of course, is that there is no major event that happens.\\nBut if things continue as they are, we expect that the sector will continue to do\\nwell. One, there is the demand side. In fact, the sector is supply constrained.\\nAs more capacity comes on board, they should continue to do very well. More\\nimportantly, while they did a great job dealing with the pandemic, many\\nstructural changes that need to be done have been identified, and those are\\nlonger term programs that will need to be put in place.\\nSo, we expect a lot more of preparatory investments amongst the more\\nforward-looking customers, and very high profitability during the course of this\\nyear will give them that war chest they require to make the investment for\\nincreasing the resilience of their network and resilience of their operation in\\nany future potential scenarios.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Sudheer Guntupalli from Kotak Mahindra\\nAsset Management. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nRajesh, it has been almost 10 to 13 months since the inflation, macro, and\\ngeopolitical concerns surfaced, and some of the upstream segments of the\\ntech ecosystem, like internet or software started flagging off on demand\\nconcerns. But so far if we look at your reported revenue growth, some of the\\nforward-looking metrics or even your commentary, the situation for us seem to\\nbe reasonably strong, fairly resilient. If we take cues from the lag times between\\nimpact on upstream and downstream tech players historically, if something\\ncould have gone wrong massively, it should have gone wrong by now. What\\ndo you think is happening differently now. Is it the case that IT services\\nbusiness has become less correlated with macro in the cycle, or you think time\\nlag for the impact will be little longer this time around?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nI think as I've always said, the best way to think about IT is to think of it as an\\nindustrial perennial. The tech needs of an enterprise will evolve over a cycle,\\nbut it is not totally discretionary. So, that's one aspect of it.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 15 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Q3 FY23 Earnings Conference Call\\nJanuary 9, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (08:30 hrs US ET)\\nThe second aspect of it is that compared to let's say even five years ago, the\\ntechnology landscape has stabilized significantly. There was a lot more\\nheterogeneity in the landscape, and a lot more competing solutions in the\\nlandscape earlier. And now there is a fair amount of convergence on the main\\nplatforms, and the main basic architectural elements. So, in the wider\\ntechnology products marketplace, that shakeout will be visible, which is normal\\nat this stage of a technology adoption cycle.\\nBut the focus in terms of actual enterprise investments to execute on those\\ntransformations is continuing.So, lesser number of platforms, greater focus on\\nlarger programs, much calmer technology environment – all this is typical at\\nthis stage of technology adoption cycle. So, probably that also kind of reflects\\nin the difference between the product space and the services space. But\\nbeyond that, I don't think we have any greater visibility.\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nMy second question. There is the broad agreement by now is that growth for\\nthe industry in FY'24 will revert to pre-COVID levels impacted by macro issues\\nand the unwind of COVID pull forward impact, etc., Keeping aside the\\nnegativity around the near term, how do you think of the medium term growth\\nprospects for TCS… not asking for a hard guidance, but do you continue to\\nbelieve that once this near term noise around macro, etc., is in the base and\\nbehind us, growth rates can again accelerate back to double digits, which has\\nbeen our medium term aspiration?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nWe believe so. Our stance is quite positive, and as I said, if you take marketby-market, in the US, we definitely think that's the scenario. In UK, we are\\nparticipating very well. The market itself is challenged. In Europe, once the\\ngeopolitical situation calms down, we believe that we have the full suite of\\ncapabilities to be able to participate. When decision-making restarts, we should\\nbe participating well.\\nSo, overall, we are quite confident about having the full suite of services to be\\nable to be relevant to customers across a wide spectrum of actual scenarios,\\nand therefore we are quite confident about the medium to long term outlook.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from CLSA. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nPankaj Kapoor:\\n\\nI have two questions. First, Rajesh, you mentioned that there is a higher share\\nof cost take out deals which are now coming in the pipeline. So, just wanted to\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 16 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Q3 FY23 Earnings Conference Call\\nJanuary 9, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (08:30 hrs US ET)\\nunderstand, if such deals are also moving faster in terms of decision-making?\\nAnd any color if you can give on the competitive intensity for such deals, I\\nmean, is it normal or are you seeing such deals getting more competitively bid\\nnow by other vendors?\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nSpeed is varying by markets. I would say that in the UK, decision making is\\nquite fast, customers are very clear, and there is a lot of action happening\\nthere. The US is normal. It continues to be doing well, but that does not account\\nfor the short-term aspect of that market. Everybody is a bit cautious for the time\\nbeing, but we don't think that will last into next year. In three months’ time, we\\nshould be able to know better. In Europe, decision making has significantly\\nslowed down. So, that's the full spectrum there.\\nIn terms of competitive intensity, many of the deal structures are quite complex.\\nThat narrows down the field to a more limited set of competitors. Within that,\\nobviously, people are aggressive and everybody is hungry. But at least the\\ncompetition set is a much narrower set than just a few years ago, when deals\\nwere smaller, and there was a lot more focus on immediacy of response and\\nthe supply side was challenged.\\n\\nPankaj Kapoor:\\n\\nMy second question is on the special dividend. With this, you would have\\nalmost paid out the entire amount that we paid last year, which included a\\nbuyback. So, does this mean there is a rethink in terms of the mode of capital\\nreturn in favor of dividend versus buyback?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nNo, rather than looking at it in absolute terms, on INR terms, we are growing\\nat 15%-plus kind of basis. So, if you consider that growth, we are still\\nbenchmarked to 80% to 100% of net profit or free cash flow kind of a trajectory,\\nnot much of difference to that.\\n\\nPankaj Kapoor:\\n\\nSo, buyback remains something which our board can consider whenever the\\nwindow opens up?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nAs you know, the current regulations require a 12-month gap between the two\\nbuyback announcements. Buyback will be considered when it becomes\\npossible from the regulatory perspective. Right now, we are in a period where\\nwe couldn't anyway consider a buyback.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 17 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Q3 FY23 Earnings Conference Call\\nJanuary 9, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (08:30 hrs US ET)\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nRajesh, one broader question. At an industry level where are we in terms of\\nthe cloud transformational journey or adoption by the enterprise client? And do\\nyou believe the pace of the adoption can change starting from CY'23 onwards\\nirrespective of the macro issues?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nCloud adoption journey is, I would say, a third of the way in.\\nDifferent customers have different challenges there. Some of them who have\\ngone very rapidly to the cloud, mostly lift and shift, are realizing that unless it\\nis architected right, cloud costs are actually quite difficult to manage and it's a\\nfairly large bill that can come if you do not architect and if you do not actively\\nmanage the cloud environment. So, some of the transformation activities and\\nprojects that we're doing is to actually help them execute that transformation\\nagenda so that their application stack is architected in a manner in which it can\\nfully leverage the variability that the cloud model offers. Unless you're able to\\nactually switch off and release the resource, you will not participate in the\\nvariability. And to be able to do that you need to be able to architect your\\napplication properly so that resource dependency can be switched off on a\\nvariabalized manner depending on what your requirements are. So, that's one\\nkind of work that is going on.\\nThe other kind of work that's going on is actually the migration itself of complex\\nworkloads that require a lot more of heavy lifting. That is the other kind of an\\narea that there's a lot of work going on. Neither of them is easy to execute. So,\\nyou should not expect much acceleration. The next couple of years are going\\nto be about execution, rigor, operational capabilities. But it will be a steady\\nmove, neither is it likely to accelerate significantly, neither is it likely to\\ndecelerate or fall off. The movement is committed, the direction is very clear,\\nthe investments are in place and the deals are in place. Now, the execution\\nand the operations have to happen. That's likely going to be the story for the\\nnext year or two.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nJust a question in terms of CY'23 IT budgets. Do you believe the spend of the\\nIT budgets could be conservative in the first half of the calendar year versus\\nthe second half or you expect the spend to be remain normal like any other\\nyear, though the budgets may be slightly lower versus the earlier last two years\\nbecause of the macro slowdown?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nAgain, going by market-by-market, in the UK, unlikely that it is any different\\nthan last year, because there is no incremental shift in the overall environment\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 18 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

In the US, we'll have to wait and see how the next couple of months\\nplays out. We are positive or rather we are hopeful, but we'll have to actually\\nwait for actual confirmation to come. We think the immediate caution that is\\nthere, probably will dissipate a few months into the year. In Europe, we will\\nhave to wait for some major event to happen for it to change. Europe will be\\nincrementally cautionary this year compared to last year.\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nJust a last bookkeeping question. I think this third-party pass-through cost\\nincrease this time does not relate to the domestic revenue, if I'm not wrong, it\\nrelates to the international revenue and will it be a growth headwind in the\\nfourth quarter if it doesn't repeat?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nSo, third-party costs actually you could link it to the domestic revenue. There\\nhas been a sequential increase, and typically Q3 has some bit of it coming in.\\nOn a year-on-year basis, we don't see that big jump.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nNext question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nSo, Regional Markets and Others segment had an acceleration year-on-year\\ngrowth versus the last quarter despite muted growth in India. Should we think\\nthat this comes from improved traction in the insurance BPaaS area? I think\\nNGS mentioned six new go lives in the quarter for BaNCS. Any large deals\\nhere that you'd like to call out or maybe you also share some comments on the\\ndeal pipeline in this segment?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nI'm sorry, I didn't hear you properly. Could you repeat the question?\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nNGS, you talked about the six new go lives this quarter for BaNCS. Just\\nwondering if there are any large deals in the BPaaS segment in insurance, and\\nhow the pipeline is shaping up there?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nOne of the areas where we are seeing opportunities and significant pipeline is\\nthe various digital core, whether it is banking or capital markets or insurance,\\nall of them are looking at putting together a new digital core. And it's going\\nthrough a lull period in the last about two years or so. But now, people are\\nthinking about a new core banking system, or a new security settlement\\nsystem, which are really architected for the future, which are cloud-native,\\nwhich are inherently micro services or inherently comes with that capability of\\nmarketplace with significant amount of APIs and micro services that will enable\\nthem to integrate into the ecosystem.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 19 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

At this moment we're working on three or\\nfour such opportunities where some of the large banks are looking at\\nmodernizing their core in favor of something which is completely open banking,\\nopen APIs. So are some of the market infrastructure institutions trying to create\\nopen payment system, and some of them typically say that whatever you guys\\nhave implemented in India, can you offer this whole instant digital payment\\ninfrastructure in our geography? So, these are the opportunities that are\\ncoming out of it, and there are a decent number of opportunities in the pipeline\\nthat we see in banking as well as capital markets.\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nSG&A, travel costs have increased sharply. How close to normal, Samir do\\nyou think we are in business travel? I think we are still about 30 bps below what\\nwe used to clock pre-COVID. So, should we think of travel as a continued\\nheadwind or you think we'll stabilize at this level?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nYes, as normalcy continues to get through, we would expect travel costs to\\ncontinue to increase. If you look at it more on the direct revenue side or the\\ndirect cost side, a lot of it is coming in. On SG&A, as things open up more on\\nsales-related costs, as well as team building exercises and team meetings\\nhappening, that cost is increasing. We’re seeing it going back to what it was\\npre-pandemic.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Abhishek Kumar from JM Financial. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nI have a question on budgets. Rajesh, you mentioned in the US there is a wait\\nand watch mode and therefore budget could take some time. Is there any\\npossibility because of that there was probably a little bit of budget flush in 4Q\\nwhich could have supported the growth?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nSorry, budget flush due to what?\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nSee, there's possibly an indecision or wait and watch mode for CY'23 budget.\\nSo, to exhaust CY'22 budgets, any possibility that there is a budget flush to\\nexhaust the previous year's budget?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 20 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

CY'23 will be slightly delayed in a couple of months… but\\nagain, it's entirely in the realm of speculation. So, we'll have to just wait and\\nsee how it plays out in the next few months.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nAnother related question to this is given this little bit of indecision in US, do you\\nthink the cost takeout projects in US probably would be low compared to other\\ngeographies, at the same time spending on discretionary would be cautious\\nand that would probably keep the budgets little low?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nYes, fair assumption. Even if you look at our US TCV, that is down both\\nsequentially and on a year-on-year basis. So, TCV still reflects that decisionmaking lag in this quarter.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nSo, firstly, Rajesh, is it fair to believe that the ACV growth could be lower than\\nTCV growth as mix of the deals are changing, and should that be even\\nconsidered as a lead indicator for growth going forward or you think the deal\\nwin trajectory could actually shift upwards over the coming quarters?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nGaurav, I don't have a direct answer to that, but there is not much of change in\\nterms of the mix of deal structures between large or small or long dated or\\nsmall dated. So, nothing that we can call out over the last two, three quarters\\nthat we can say that we're seeing. There is an elongation in decision making,\\nwhich we had spoken about last quarter also and which has also played out\\nthis quarter. So, that the pipeline growth and the qualified pipeline growth is\\nahead of the actual TCV growth that we're seeing…in fact, we have seen a\\nsequential decline in TCV while our qualified pipeline still continues to grow in\\nabsolute terms. So, beyond that, the specific mix of deals is not materially\\nchanging.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nSecondly, on the margins, as headwinds on attrition subside, would our\\nimmediate priority be to take margins back to our aspirational band of 26%,\\n28% or would we prefer to prioritize some investments, keeping margin stable\\nafter recovering it to 25%?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nGaurav, our margins or our industry-leading margins are on the back of the\\ninvestments which we make, and most of our investments, whether it is in\\nterms of talent, in terms of research and innovation, or branding, all are\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 21 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nAshwin Mehta:\\n\\nRajesh, we've seen pretty strong growth in regional market and others over the\\nlast two quarters; it's of the order of almost 6% sequentially. So, what is the\\nnature of demand here and how sustainable is this going forward?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nThe reason of calling the segment out is because it's volatile and difficult to\\npredict. So, its sustainability is difficult to answer. From a nature perspective\\nit's come both from the market side – India has done very well, in fact, APAC\\nex-Australia also have done well. So, markets have done well, as also the\\nproduct side of the business that NGS spoke about on the FS and platform\\nside also has done well. So, it's come from both sides, markets as well as from\\nthe products side.\\n\\nAshwin Mehta:\\n\\nSecond question was you mentioned in the press conference as well that\\nmanufacturing has been more resilient compared to your expectations. So, any\\ntrends that we can take from manufacturing given the fact that if we look at\\nclient financials, manufacturing growth over the next two years is expected to\\nbe actually better than what it was before?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nI didn't know that, but that correlates to what we are also seeing. But I'm still\\nwary, because of all the global supply chain disruption and energy price\\ndisruption. Industries like process manufacturing are much more globally\\nintegrated, and not as isolated as, let's say, Retail. So, we are still cautious.\\nOur operating approach is always the same; stay close to the customer, deal\\nwith the customer on an individual opportunity-to-opportunity basis and we will\\ncontinue to participate on that basis. But on a zoomed-out way, talking to\\ncustomers, it is an industry that's not completely out of the woods.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is from the line of Rahul Jain from Dolat Capital.

Good morning, good afternoon and good evening to all of\\nyou. In FY 2023, our full year revenue grew at 17.6% in rupee terms, 13.7% in\\nconstant currency terms and 8.6% in dollar terms. Our operating margin for the\\nyear came in at 24.1% and net margin was at 18.7%.\\nAs you are aware, four weeks ago, we announced a leadership transition at\\nTCS. I'll be stepping down from my role and stepping away from TCS on\\nSeptember 15th. The Board identified Krithi, who has led our largest segment,\\nBFSI, over the last many years, as the CEO-Designate. Today, the Board also\\nannounced that Krithi will be taking over the role of CEO and MD on June 1st.\\nWe are currently going through a structured transition plan and for the purpose\\nof this call, I will speak about the year gone by, and he will cover the forwardlooking topics.\\nI'll first invite Samir, Milind and NGS to go over the different aspects of our\\nperformance during the quarter. Krithi and I will step in later to provide more\\ncolor on the demand trends we're seeing. Over to you, Samir.\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nThank you Rajesh. In the fourth quarter of financial year 2023, our revenue\\nwas `59,162 crore, which is a year-on-year growth of 16.9%. In dollar terms,\\nrevenue was $7.195 billion, a year-on-year growth of 7.4%. In constant\\ncurrency, our revenue growth in Q4 was 10.7%.\\nFor the full year, our revenue was `225,458 crore, which is a growth of 17.6%\\nover the prior year. In dollar terms, the reported revenue was $27.927 billion,\\na growth of 8.6%. Constant currency revenue growth for the full year was\\n13.7%.\\nLet me go over our financial performance. Our operating margin in Q4 stayed\\nflat sequentially at 24.5%. With supply-side challenges abating, we were able\\nto further bring down our use of sub-contractors in Q4. The benefit of that, other\\nefficiencies and some currency gains was canceled out by higher on-site costs.\\nOur full year operating margin was at 24.1%, a contraction of 1.2% over the\\nprior year. In terms of headwinds, our annual wage increase set us back by\\n1.6%. The supply side challenges during the year cost us another 1.4% and\\ntravel expenses went up by 0.3%. This was mitigated by 0.5% of realization\\nimprovement, 0.5% of benefit from a flatter employee pyramid and 1.1% of\\ncurrency benefit.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 2 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

TCS\\nleveraged its deep contextual knowledge, TCS Cognix, and MFDM to deliver\\nthe transformation. This resulted in a robust operating model that delivered\\nhigher levels of certainty with uninterrupted and enhanced services for its\\ncustomers. The superior quality of service contributed to industry-leading\\ncustomer satisfaction, improved NPS and lower churn.\\nIn Q4, we won an all-time high number of large operations transformation\\ndeals. Here are a couple of examples.\\nTCS was selected by IHG Hotels and Resorts, one of the world's leading hotel\\ncompanies to drive enterprise process automation across several IHG\\nbusinesses and business verticals, including finance, travel agent commission,\\nrevenue compliance and audit, revenue services, sales and HR.

During the year, clients\\nengaged us to take up their more complex, bigger workloads and accelerate\\nthe modernization and migration to the cloud. This trend continued in Q4 and\\nwe won several new deals around this field.

Let me take the first part and then I'll have Krithi answer both\\nthe FY 24 and the demand forward. If you look at where the impact has come\\nfrom, I would say that we shared with you in the last quarter's comments,\\nbeginning of this year, that while there was softness in US in Q3, that is our\\nQ3, calendar Q4, we expected that it would significantly pick up in the New\\nYear. And that's just adequate caution on the client's part resulting in softness\\nin Q3.\\nThat expectation has not borne out. It has, in fact, turned incrementally even\\nmore negative. That sentiment trigger obviously was to a large extent what\\nhappened on the banking side in US, but it has also been across the board.\\nSo, if you look at areas like Manufacturing, especially on the process and\\nindustrial side, that is reflecting the weakness from a more global perspective.\\nAreas like Retail in the US are reflecting the sentiment of the local market and\\nespecially on the expectation from what's going on in the credit terms.\\nSo going back to your question, the change is more in terms of the US market.\\nWe expected it to come back strongly in the New Year. That has not happened\\nand that's the scenario that we are in. And the weakness is not just coming out\\nof the BFSI, it is coming across sectors in North America. Krithi, do you want\\nto talk about BFSI and the expectation forward?\\n\\nK. Krithivasan:\\n\\nLike Rajesh mentioned, there has been weakness in BFSI because of the\\nmarket uncertainty in the last quarter. But as we mentioned, the order book\\nhas been quite strong, in fact one of the highest order books that we have in\\nthe recent past. And like we also commented, the order book is less lengthy\\nand it has more smaller deals or short duration deals, which means the revenue\\nconversion could be even higher.\\nBut having said that, like we are not going to give guidance for immediate\\nquarters because uncertainty is still there and clients are still looking at their\\npriorities and things they want to spend. But we are comfortable with the\\nmedium to long-term spend looking at our order book. So the demand still is\\nstrong and order book quality is good.

As a follow-up on the strategy, TCS changes its guard very rarely and\\nvery smoothly historically. Could you comment on any change in strategy, both\\nbecause of the change in guard and the change in demand sentiment at the\\nmoment?\\n\\nK. Krithivasan:\\n\\nLeadership change doesn't mean a strategy change. All of us have been\\nworking with this organization for so many years and all of us have a good\\nunderstanding. Whatever strategy Rajesh put in place was also a collective\\nleadership decision on how we want to go forward. So I don't expect a drastic\\nstrategy change. We'll be tweaking what we do based on the market situation.\\nOur strategy is anyway based on client centricity and employee empathy. So\\nthose two are the basic pillars, we’ll continue to drive home our strategy based\\non that.\\n\\nAnkur Rudra:\\n\\nThank you. Maybe the last question on technology. Just curious to hear your\\nthoughts as a leadership group on how generative AI changes the nature of\\ntechnology consumption and if it impacts the bargaining power for clients or for\\nTCS over the medium term?\\n\\nK. Krithivasan:\\n\\nI'll turn this over to our ChatGPT guru, Mr. NGS.\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nHi Ankur, NGS here. I think generative AI as a technology is very interesting.\\nWe have been working on it for some time and we have done some pilots\\ninternally and I think it has the potential to live up to the expectation that every\\narea can be technology driven. That is number one.\\nNumber two is that it can further accelerate the adoption of technology,\\nincluding those which are at the frontier areas of innovation. We are quite\\nexcited about it.\\nMany quarters ago, I think at one of the analyst calls, I mentioned that AI/ML\\nhas the potential to fundamentally change the way that we deliver software to\\nour clients.

We have a next question from the line of Sudheer Guntupalli from\\nKotak Mahindra Asset Management. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nYes. Krithi, firstly congratulations and all the best in your new innings. Couple\\nof questions from my side. The prevailing industry perception seems to be that\\nbecause of macro uncertainty, deal mix is shifting towards cost optimization,\\nwhich are typically large deals that may take longer time lines for revenue\\nconversion. But your prepared remarks suggest the contrary about the order\\nbook that got built during FY 23. So how do we read this contradiction?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nSudheer, cost and optimization deals need not be large. Very often, customers\\nlook at immediate operations because in times of uncertainty, they want to\\ncontrol cost and so something quick. So the deals are cooked in a way that\\nthey can also get benefits immediately.\\nLike we discussed before, our order book is actually very less lumpy, with just\\none mega deal and a number of medium to small-sized deals. So that gives us\\nthe confidence that there will be faster revenue conversion. I don't know\\nwhether we can say that all cost and optimization deals will be larger. Some of\\nthem may be larger, many of them need not be.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nGot it. And you made an interesting point in the press meet that many of your\\nclients, which are the large US banks are benefiting because of recent banking\\nissues and the consequent deposit flight. So if the banking situation doesn't\\nmaterially escalate from here on and as and when the negative sentiments\\nreceived, could this be a net positive outcome for TCS over the next 12 to 18\\nmonths, given some of the key clients are actually becoming stronger with a\\nfurther possibility of M&A integration related spend?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 15 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We have a very strong presence\\nin the banking sector and we will continue to work with our clients closely to\\nbring in solutions by which they can leverage the market conditions and\\nleverage extra deposits they get.

Thank you Rajesh, and all the best for your\\nfuture endeavors and congratulations, Krithi, for your new role. The first\\nquestion is just an extension to what Ankur has asked. So looking at your\\ncommentary, it seems that there could be a near-term pressure or caution from\\nclients’ side in terms of the IT spend. So FY 24 could be slightly different where\\ngrowth could be back-ended versus front-ended, which is seasonally the trend\\nin most of the normal years? Or do you believe FY '24 may have a soft growth\\nacross all the four quarters?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nSandeep, I don't want to comment on the overall FY 24. As we called out, Q4\\nhas been soft because of the uncertainties. And those uncertainties are not\\nfully resolved. At the same time, we are comfortable with the order book we\\nsee. And we also commented on the tenure of the order book in terms of the\\nshort duration of the project.\\nSo that gives us the confidence that many of these projects will get done in a\\nshort period of time and we'll be able to realize the revenue. But we cannot\\ntake away the fact that there could be some transformation project or\\ndiscretionary project that could get cancelled if there is a further deterioration\\nof the sentiment. So, these are all the facts that we are working with. But we'll\\ncontinue to be close to our customers. We don't want to comment on how Q1\\nor Q2 is going to be or how FY 24 is going to be.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nOkay, fair enough. Just a question in terms of margin. Can you explain what\\nwas the nature of the on-site cost pressure during 4Q? And also question about\\nFY 24 margin, because FY 23 margin has been impacted by supply-side issue.\\nWith supply-side issues abating, whether it is fair to say the margin\\nmanagement could be better in FY '24 versus FY '23, or it is hard to say\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 16 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We have our next question from the line of Abhishek Kumar from\\nJM Financial. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nGood evening. I just wanted to understand what is driving the growth in the UK\\nmarket? Rajesh, you had mentioned in the last quarter that unlike continental\\nEurope and the US, in UK there is some clarity. They had moved decisively\\ntowards the cost takeout project. I’m just trying to tie it up with Krithi’s comment\\nthat cost takeout projects may not be longer gestation period projects. And is\\nthat something, the clarity in terms of what they need to do reflecting in better\\ngrowth in UK? And if that is the case, would that be a template that US also\\ncan follow once there is some sort of clarity either way, either on the\\ndiscretionary side or on the cost takeout side, things could quickly come back\\nand the growth can resume?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nAbhishek, UK is exactly what you described and what we said in the past. The\\nmarket is reconciled to the operating environment and knows that it needs to\\ndo something because externally nothing is going to change. And it is not just\\ncost takeout, transformation projects are also ongoing.\\nLast quarter, we had spoken about a very large telecom deal. That was a\\ncombination of cost takeout as well as a massive movement onto the cloud to\\nbe able to make their whole enterprise stack agile, so that they can introduce\\nnew products faster and respond to market conditions differently.\\nSimilarly, in the utility sector, we have spoken about how the market regulator\\nis moving to introduce greater competition and greater agility there. We worked\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 17 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nApril 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nwith the Rail Delivery Group, which is another regulator on the transportation\\nside, which is also moving massively to leverage data and introduce greater\\nagility, and use the data to improve overall efficiency of the system and to\\nenable newer entrants to come in and to offer services.\\nSo, it would be wrong to characterize the UK market as a purely cost takeout\\nmarket. It is a market where the structural cost bases are being reset, but\\nsignificantly new competitive forces are also at play as industry structures are\\nbeing actively worked on. We are participating very strongly across the board.\\nAs you know, we are the largest services provider in the UK market by a margin\\nand that is playing to our advantage because our ability to shape the\\nopportunity and to participate in it is very very significant. Interestingly, it is\\nhappening not just on the private side, but on the public sector and the semipublic sector side also, where also our participation is very high. So, UK is a\\ngreat story about technology being part of the solution for any such scenario.\\nNow, will that play out in US? That depends on the nature of the US always\\nhas been at the forefront of leveraging technology. US companies as an overall\\necosystem are also much more dynamic, much more decisive in moving and\\nmuch more risk taking. So, the starting base is very different.\\nSo, does UK provide a playbook? Not on a like-to-like basis. But conceptually,\\nour entire business model is predicated on the belief that what we are seeing\\nin UK is likely to play out in market after market, where technology leverage\\nwill only keep on increasing rather than decreasing, in any scenario, whether\\nit is a challenges scenario or a growth scenario. What we need to do is to make\\nsure that our service portfolio is fully able to participate on both sides of the\\nspectrum simultaneously.\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nThat is very insightful. Thank you and all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from\\nCLSA. Please go ahead.\\n\\nPankaj Kapoor:\\n\\nThanks for the opportunity. Rajesh, wish you the best and Krithi,\\ncongratulations. Can you give some color on how the deal velocity panned out\\nwithin the quarter? Did you see clients delaying decisions on deals that would\\nhave otherwise closed by, say, March end in the last, say, 15-odd days? And\\nif possible, can you quantify the impact of that?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 18 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

In fact, if anything, it has accelerated,\\nespecially in Europe. We have seen significant acceleration in decision making\\non deals in Europe. We had called out delays earlier but in Q4, we have seen\\nan acceleration. If you look at deals greater than $50 million, we have closed\\nmore deals in this quarter in Europe than what we did in the first three quarters\\nof the year. Is that just a catch-up to things that got delayed during the year,\\nwe'll have to wait and see.\\nComing to the pipeline, there too we had shared with you in the past that in\\nEurope, though the decision making was slow, the pipeline buildup was very\\nsteady and very encouraging. So we'll have to wait and see how it translates\\nin the next two quarters. But this quarter, decision making in Europe has\\nincreased.\\nIt's very encouraging because initially, we told you about how the sentiment\\nhad turned incrementally positive in Europe, both on their overall economic\\nside, having dealt with the winter positively, receding fears on an energy crisis\\nand also increasing optimism on the China scenario. So that positive sentiment\\nhas resulted now in increasing deal closures. We’ll have to wait and see how\\nit turns out in the rest of it.\\nUS also, our TCV has been very strong. And it has been strong through the\\nquarter, even in March. And it is coming across both existing customers as well\\nas new customers. In fact, in this year, our new client TCV in the US has been\\na record high. So there is nothing that shows that deal flow has actually slowed\\ndown. In fact, as I said, one specific market, Europe, it has actually accelerated.\\n\\nPankaj Kapoor:\\n\\nSo is it fair to assume that events of last few weeks actually had an impact\\nmore in terms of client just pausing ongoing projects, which is the reason why\\nwe saw the impact on the reported revenues, but the deal decision making has\\nnot been impacted?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nAbsolutely, Pankaj. Narrowly answering the question, that's exactly right. The\\nrevenue impact is due to discretionary projects being deferred, or expected\\nproject startups getting delayed. We have not seen large scale project\\ncancellation. We have not seen deal flow slow down. It's a very immediate,\\nshort-term kind of impact that we've seen play out over the last couple of\\nmonths. But it requires close watching to see how it develops through the\\ncourse of the next quarter.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 19 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Samir, my question was again, on the higher onsite cost.\\nYou mentioned subcontractor replacement was the reason, but I'm just\\nwondering, wouldn't that be already baked in when you spoke of the 25% exit\\nmargin in the previous call, and the currency tailwind that we saw was not\\nanticipated? So if you can just help understand what was the math there?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nOn the onsite costs, it was not just subcontractors but also additional local\\nhiring. On why we ended up here and not at 25%, that is not just because of\\njust the higher onsite costs. It is also due to customer sentiments turning\\nincreasingly negative from where we started off at the beginning of the\\ncalendar year to what we saw in February and March. When discretionary\\nprojects are paused, that has an immediate impact on the revenues while we\\ncontinue to incur the related costs in the short term. And that's why we couldn't\\nexit at where we had targeted.\\n\\nPankaj Kapoor:\\n\\nUnderstood. Thank you and wish you all the best.\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Gaurav Rateria from\\nMorgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nHi, thank you for taking my questions. So, first question, just going back to the\\nconversion of the order book to revenue, just to get it a little better, is it fair to\\nsay that last year you ended the order book on TCV basis, a particular growth,\\nyour ACV growth would have been slower than that? And this year in FY '23,\\nyour ACV growth would have been better than the TCV growth, which gives\\nyou more confidence on your faster conversion of order book to revenue for\\nnext year. Just trying to understand, is that the correct understanding?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nGaurav, we do not comment on ACV. I do not want to get dragged into it. But\\nfrom the perspective of the composition of the order book this year, it is more\\nweighted towards the medium-sized deals than mega deals. So, you know, the\\n$50 - $100 million range has been a larger constituent rather than the $500\\nmillion plus book.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nGot it. Secondly, Rajesh, you mentioned that the sentiment in Europe has kind\\nof improved and that has reflected in better velocity of the deal flows. Is it fair\\nto say that at least for the next two quarters, the growth drivers for overall\\nrevenue will be more led by Europe than the US?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 20 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

But I don’t know, we will have to wait and see how it, Europe\\nis also complex, especially BFSI. Do you want to comment on BFSI?\\n\\nMilind Lakkad:\\n\\nGaurav, if you look at Europe, different regions play out differently. In BFSI, we\\nare seeing good traction in Nordics and Benelux. Central Europe is slightly\\ncomplex and difficult. So, to make a generic statement that Europe would turn\\nout to be more positive will not be appropriate. Each vertical and each region\\nis going to play out differently. Overall, the sentiment is improving. We are not\\nsaying that it has become strong overnight that it will drive our growth. It's\\nimproving.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nGot, it. Last question. Rajesh mentioned about the kind of reorienting the\\noperating model to adjust in line with the changed macro conditions from a cost\\nstructure perspective. So, typically it takes about a quarter or two to kind of\\nadjust that or make that adjustment within the operating model. And, is that a\\nfair assessment from a margin perspective in the sense that it takes about a\\nquarter or two to reflect that the cost structure and the better margins from\\noverall company standpoint?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nActually, let me explain what I meant. I kind of carried over from the discussion\\nin the press conference. As you know, our reliance on contingent labor has\\nsignificantly increased, mainly because of the various travel restrictions and\\nsupply side challenges in the local market.\\nA combination of high demand and significant dislocation on the supply side\\nhad resulted in a significant increase in our dependence on contingent labor.\\nWe are structurally and systematically moving to go back to our more preferred\\noperating model, which is about 5% to 8% of our onsite workforce being\\ncontingent labor.\\nThis is also very important for us to ensure quality of delivery and to manage\\nthe overall experience at the customer level. So we have been systematically\\nexecuting that. We are about 25% lower than our peak contingent labor\\nreliance in the North America geography. We have quite a distance to go to\\nbring it back to our desired operating range, and we will continue to do that,\\nrelying on improvements in the travel and visa availability.\\nOnce we have that, we will again have a greater ability to flex up and down\\ndepending on where the demand is. So, that is where I was coming from. This\\nis a multi-quarter journey and it is not purely driven from a cost perspective. It\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 21 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And, if it reduces, we will keep on\\nsystematically bringing this down, benefiting margins because it is typically\\nmore costly than our long-term employee base.\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nGot, it. Thanks for the explanation Rajesh and all the best for your future\\nendeavors and congratulations to Krithi. Thank you.\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Ravi Menon from\\nMacquarie. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThank you. This is similar to what Pankaj asked that the way the deals have\\ncome through, you know, it shows that the demand environment has not really\\nchanged, but the quarters of early growth, it has become pretty negative. So,\\nare you seeing this change in pipeline or delays in decision making that this\\nnegativity is not just temporary caution? Or should we think about this as\\nsomething similar to furloughs and we will see this come back in a quarter or\\ntwo?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nRavi, as of now, no. But we'll have to wait and see if it persists, and how it turns\\nout. As of now, we have not seen any significant change in the deal pipeline.\\nAnd the actual pipeline replenishment continues to be quite strong. But we'll\\nhave to carefully watch how the decision-making plays out in the next quarter\\nor so.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nAnd you had talked last quarter of a more normalized annual gross hiring of\\naround 125,000 to 150,000 people as attrition normalizes. Is that still the range\\nyou're working with?\\n\\nMilind Lakkad:\\n\\nSee, we don't call out on gross hiring for the year. In general, for the campus\\nhires, I talked about 40,000 campus hires. Number of lateral hires will be\\ndependent on the demand from the business every quarter.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThanks. And one last follow-up, if I may.

We have a next question from the line of Vibhor Singhal from\\nNuvama Equities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nThanks for taking my question. So, just a couple of questions from my side.\\nLast quarter, we mentioned that the growth in the retail vertical last quarter was\\nprimarily driven by the travel vertical. Does that continue to be the case this\\nquarter as well? And how is the core non-travel part of the retail function, say\\nthe FMCG and the CPG part of the business faring on an overall company\\nbasis. My second question was on the overall scenario at this point of time. I\\nmean I'm sure the TCS management has been through similar kinds of\\ndownturn before and come out of that challenge as well. So typically, in these\\nkind of economic slowdowns or downturns, do clients end up asking for pricing\\ndiscounts or do competitors resort to some pricing under cuts, which basically\\nforces us also to maybe follow them, which would impact the profitability or the\\ngrowth or both in this kind of a scenario?\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nSorry, I was on mute. On the Retail side, TTH [Travel Transportation and\\nHospitality] continues to do well. But our performance is not purely driven by\\nthat. Especially in this quarter, most segments have done well. Essential retail\\nhas done well. Some parts of discretionary retail and fashion have been\\nchallenged. North America retail has been quite weak, whereas North America\\ntravel continues to do well.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 23 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nApril 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nSo overall, most segments are doing well with Travel and Hospitality\\noutperforming within that, and North America retail underperforming. That's the\\nway to understand this quarter's retail side of it.\\nOn the pricing side, we have had this discussion earlier too. In our industry,\\nunlike a product industry, discounting and price undercutting is not as easy\\nbecause an incremental deal is one thing. But once you offer a price, it's very\\nvisible across your entire customer universe. So the ability to do that in a very\\nsystematic manner is quite restricted. So it's a much more disciplined industry\\nin terms of pricing. That is what's playing out. We'll keep watching it. We will\\nstay tactically responsive in the market, and we'll deal with it as it comes.\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nGot, it. Thanks for taking my questions. And wish you all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now\\nhand the conference over to management for the closing comments.\\n\\nRajesh Gopinathan:\\n\\nThank you. We are pleased with our FY 23 performance, growing at 17.6% in\\nrupee terms and 13.7% in constant currency terms. The steadily deteriorating\\nmacro environment has meant decelerating second half. Our Q4 revenue\\ngrowth was 16.9 in rupee terms and 10.7 in constant currency. However, we\\nhave had a very strong order book with an all-time high number of large deals.\\nOur operating margin in Q4 was flat sequentially at 24.5%, and our net margin\\nwas at 19.3%.

We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the\\nquarterly fact sheet available on our website and emailed out to those who\\nhave subscribed for our, on our mailing list. With that, I would like to turn the\\ncall over to Krithi.\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nThank you, Kedar. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening to all of you.\\nOur Q2 performance shows continued strength and demand for our services,\\nparticularly around cloud and cost optimization, resulting in strong deal wins, a\\nrobust order book, and a good pipeline.\\nThis was true in prior quarters as well. In each of the past three quarters, our\\norder book has exceeded $10 billion TCV compared to the average of $7 to $8\\nbillion range in the 2021 and 2022.\\nThe newly won deals are converting into revenue as expected, but these\\nrevenue inflows are getting neutralized by reduction in the existing revenue\\nbase as the transformation projects get completed, or RTB projects get\\noptimized, or in some cases, downsized. This has led to muted revenue\\ngrowth.\\nIn Q2, our revenue grew 7.9% in rupee terms, 2.8% in constant currency terms,\\nand 4.8% in dollar terms. Our operating margin was at 24.3%, and net margin\\nwas at 19%.\\nI'll now invite Samir, Milind, and NGS to go over different aspects of our\\nperformance during the quarter. I'll step in later to provide more color on the\\ndemand trends we are seeing. Over to you, Samir.\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nIn the second quarter of FY24, our revenue was `59,692 crore, which is a\\nyear-on-year growth of 7.9%. In dollar terms, the revenue was $7.21 billion, a\\nY-o-Y growth of 4.8%. In constant currency terms, the revenue growth in Q2\\nwas 2.8%.\\nLet me now go over financial performance. Our operating margin is at 24.3%,\\nwhich is 110 basis points expansion sequentially. We got 100 basis points\\nbenefit from disciplined execution, which resulted in improved utilization and\\nproductivity and further optimization of subcontractor expenses.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 2 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nAdditionally, we gained 35 basis points from driving efficiencies in discretionary\\nexpenses, which I had referred to last quarter as gaining critical mass. On the\\nother hand, we continued to invest in infrastructure.\\nNet income in Q2 was 19%. Our EPS grew 8.7% on a year-on-year basis.\\nEffective tax rate stayed unchanged at 25.8%. And our accounts receivable\\nwas flat sequentially at 65 days’ sales outstanding in dollar terms.\\nNet cash from operations was at `118.23 billion, which is 104.2% of net\\nincome. Free cash flow was at `113.57 billion and invested funds as of at the\\nend of 30th September stood at `596.77 billion.\\nThe board has recommended an interim dividend of `9 per share. Further, the\\nboard has recommended a buyback to the tune of `17,000 crore through the\\ntender route at `4,150 per share. Over to you, Milind.\\nMilind Lakkad:\\n\\nThank you, Samir.\\nOur workforce at the end of the second quarter was 608,985 strong. Our\\nstrategy of proactively hiring bright freshers and investing in training them with\\nthe right skills is paying off now. With that talent coming on stream and with\\nreduced attrition, we were able to recalibrate our gross additions, keeping it\\nbelow the departures during the quarter, driving up productivity and enhancing\\nproject outcomes.\\nOur workforce continues to be very diverse with 152 nationalities and with\\nwomen making 35% of the base. We continue to invest in organic talent\\ndevelopment.\\nYear to date, TCS has logged 26.4 million learning hours and acquired 2.6\\nmillion competencies, including over 350,000 high demand competencies. We\\nhave over 100,000 Gen AI ready employees today and we are now investing\\nin deepening their expertise further on this exciting new technology.\\nLTM attrition in IT services was at 14.9%, down 2.9% sequentially, close to our\\nhistorical range of 11% to 14%.\\nOver to you NGS for some color on our segments and products and platforms.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 3 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

Before I get into segmental performance, I wanted to\\nhighlight some changes in how we report segmental performance in our fact\\nsheet from this quarter. Historically, we reported revenues from North America,\\nLatin America, UK, Europe, and Australia under the industry verticals,\\nseparating out other emerging market revenues, products and platforms and a\\nfew other small businesses, or those with atypical revenue profiles, in a\\nseparate line called Regional Markets and Others (RMO).\\nIn Q2, we made three changes:\\nFirst, we reclassified revenues from Asia Pacific (excluding Japan), and Middle\\nEast and Africa, hitherto part of RMO under their respective industry verticals.\\nSecond, with our Energy, Resources and Utilities vertical gaining critical mass,\\nwe have extracted out the first two sub-verticals from RMO, and we'll now start\\nreporting it as a standalone industry vertical.\\nWith these two changes, revenue contribution from RMO is down from over\\n17% to around 11%. We have provided comparatives for the last four quarters\\nin our fact sheet.\\nThe third change is the renaming of our retail cluster, consisting of Retail, CPG,\\nTravel, Transportation and Hospitality verticals as the Consumer Business\\nGroup or CBG.\\nLet me walk you through our segmental performance now. As a reminder, all\\ngrowth numbers are in year-on-year constant currency terms.\\nGrowth was led by the newly carved out Energy Resources and Utilities\\nvertical, which grew 14.8%. Manufacturing grew by 5.8%. And life sciences\\nand healthcare grew by 5%.\\nOur Consumer Business Group grew by 1%. Banking, Financial Services and\\nInsurance grew by -0.5%, Communications and Media by -1%, and\\nTechnology and Services by -2.2%.\\nBy geographic markets, we see maximum caution in North America and\\nContinental Europe, which grew 0.1% and 1.3% respectively.

For a global financial institution\\nbased out of South Africa, TCS has completed a massive migration from a\\nheritage platform to TCS BaNCS for insurance. This is the largest and most\\ncomplex migration of its kind in the history of the market, entailing 4 million\\npolicies. With this migration, the client's entire retail protection business is on\\nTCS BaNCS. Post migration, the policies are now available to both advisors\\nand customers through digital channels.\\nQuartz blockchain platform had 2 go-lives this quarter.\\nIn life sciences, TCS ADD platform had 2 new wins and 1 go-live this year.\\nTCS ADD Safety went live at a top 10 UK based pharma with its latest version\\nthat uses advanced AI algorithms to process adverse event cases, a first of its\\nkind in industry.\\nWith this, TCS ADD Safety has successfully automated more than 1 million\\ncases, a landmark by any technology company using AI in pharmacovigilance,\\ndelivering industry-leading efficiency and accuracy metrics.\\nTCS HOBS, our suite of products for communication service providers, had 1\\nnew win and 2 go-lives during the quarter.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 5 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Our platform administered assessments for 16.2\\nmillion candidates, 150% higher year-on-year.\\nMasterCraft and Jile won 34 new clients in Q2.\\nOur business model is built on continually delivering tangible value to our\\nclients, which results in them rewarding us with repeat business, consuming\\nmore of our services and solutions over time.\\nThe deep and enduring client relationships we build give us tremendous\\ncontextual knowledge of how their businesses runs at a very granular level, the\\nindividual processes, and how the underlying systems support them. The\\nvarious interrelationships among systems and databases and infrastructure\\nthere beneath, all these are extremely useful as we build out our Gen AI\\ncapabilities and position our Gen AI services for our large clients. This\\ncontextual knowledge and our track record of consistency and predictability in\\nour deliverables is our competitive edge.\\nFrom the outside, the success of our customer centric strategy is best validated\\nthrough client metrics we report, which show a steady increase in the number\\nof clients in every revenue bucket.\\nIn Q2, we added 2 more clients year-on-year in the $100 million+ band bringing\\nthe total to 61, 13 more clients in the $50 million+ band bringing the total 137,\\n9 more clients in the $20 million+ bringing the total to 292, 28 more clients in\\nthe $10 million+ band bringing the total to 483, 38 more clients in the $5\\nmillion+ band bringing the total to 688, and 62 more clients in the $1 million+\\nband bringing the total to 1,272.\\nI will now request Krithi to speak on the demand drivers during the quarter.\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nThank you NGS. Given client caution over the macro overhang, we continue\\nto see a reprioritization of spending from discretionary areas to cost\\noptimization. This is driving a significant deal momentum towards large\\noutsourcing deals, vendor consolidation and operating model transformations.\\nWe had a very strong order book in Q2 with a TCV of $11.2 billion, our second\\nhighest TCV ever and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.6. BFSI TCV continued to be very\\nrobust at $3 billion as also the consumer business order book at $1.4 billion.\\nThe TCV of deals signed in North America stood at $4.5 billion.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 6 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nThe order book in Q2 had two mega deals BSNL and JLR each roughly $1\\nbillion in TCV versus 1 mega deal in Q1. We had a detailed press note on the\\nJLR deal, so I won't spend time on that. But the BSNL win is very special and\\nshowcases our unique capabilities. So let me give you a high-level overview.\\nBSNL selected TCS to roll out a modern 4G and 5G mobile communication\\ninfrastructure across India covering 100,000 telecom sites. The project\\ninvolves supply, planning, design, installation and commissioning and\\noptimization of this mobile network, satisfying a detailed set of requirements\\nconforming to 3GPP standards.\\nOur solution caters to needs such as trusted source of components and\\nequipment, advanced RF planning, intelligence on the edge to support\\ncognitive network operations, software driven radios and reconfigurations and\\nso on. This is part of the Government of India's efforts to build indigenous\\ntelecom technology and local manufacturing of telecom gear. TCS and\\npartners have integrated the EPC Core, RAN and NMS and have started the\\nrollout of the network which is expected to be completed in stages over the\\nnext 18 months.\\nMoving on to other large deals, our deal momentum in operating model\\ntransformation continues to be very strong. A big differentiator for us is our TCS\\nCognix™, which significantly accelerates the operations transformation. It\\nembeds AI, machine learning and increasingly, Gen AI, to enable superior\\nbusiness outcomes with increased velocity, improved user experience,\\nreduced turnaround time and superior decision-making powered by rich\\ndashboards and predictive analytics. In Q2, we won 6 large operating model\\ntransformation deals with TCS Cognix at their core.\\nThe other interesting thing is that we also saw several large deals featuring\\nfirst-time outsourcers. For instance, we were selected by the British Council,\\nthe UK's international organization for educational opportunities and cultural\\nrelations, to transform its professional services function that includes finance,\\nprocurement, human resources and digital technology.\\nTCS will leverage its deep domain expertise and proprietary platforms to help\\ndevelop more innovative and user-friendly services. The partnership will also\\nenable the British Council to focus on improving the quality and efficiency of\\nservices, ultimately leading to an enhanced customer experience.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 7 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nLast quarter, I had highlighted how clients have taken to TCS’ integrated\\noperations model, wherein we take ownership for the entire slice of operations,\\nfrom back-end to front-end, along with the underlying application and data\\nestates and the IT infrastructure layer.\\nWe call this integrated offering, Business-as-a-Service. Our AI-powered\\nbusiness command center provides end-to-end visibility and holistic control\\nacross that entire stack, resulting in more resilient operations and better\\nalignment with business KPIs. Our proactive leverage of next-gen technologies\\nto redefine processes reduces the need for human intervention, increases\\nprocess velocity and delivers superior process outcomes.\\nFrom a competitive standpoint, our holistic approach, deep contextual\\nknowledge, and the unmatched speed to value from TCS Cognix is providing\\na deep moat that is powering strong deal wins and market share gains.\\nIn Q2, we won a large deal from a leading media company that is currently\\ntransforming to focus on new lines of business which will drive future growth.\\nThey are partnering us to improve customer retention by providing superior\\nexperience while reducing engagement costs. In keeping with our business-as\\na-service value proposition, TCS will take full ownership of the operating stack,\\nwith an integrated solution across customer interactions, which includes voice,\\nchat, email, and social, and support for the IT applications and infrastructure.\\nIncidentally, this is also a vendor consolidation across multiple countries and\\nvendors, and multiple business lines, and good illustration of how our IP and\\ninnovation differentiates us. Our solution uses TwinX, our digital twin solution\\nto model customer engagement and reduce churn; ignio to make the\\nunderlying infrastructure self-healing; and Gen AI for directing voice to chat,\\nvoice to text and for customer sentiment analysis for emotionally responsive\\nchats and emails.\\nThe level of innovation and next-gen capabilities embedded in our solution and\\nthe business alignment of our value proposition were our key differentiators in\\nwinning this large deal.\\nSpeaking of Gen AI, it continues to dominate our conversations with IT and\\nbusiness leaders in every market.

Many of\\nthe projects we executed this quarter are conceptually similar, focused on task\\nautomation around knowledge abstraction and content creation.\\nWe are now seeing a progressive increase in the complexity and sophistication\\nof Gen AI use cases, from simple knowledge discovery use cases and chatbots\\nto complex ones, such as augmentation solutions for financial advisors and\\nwealth management strategists, automated underwriting for insurance policies,\\nAI-led molecule discovery, as well as engineering design space explorations\\nfor automotive and gas turbine.\\nSlightly more mature clients are taking a broader enterprise-wide approach to\\nGen AI deployment. For a European airline, TCS is helping re-imagine its core\\nbusiness functions, leveraging Gen AI and analytics to create a future-ready\\nenterprise. The TCS team co-presented with the CTO to the Board and is now\\nengaged in helping draw up a holistic Gen AI strategy.\\nA leading US-based specialty retailer is partnering with TCS for multiple Gen\\nAI-led interventions to enrich customers as well as employee interactions,\\nincluding customer request handling, virtual assistant for shopping, knowledge\\nmanagement, designs for creatives, marketing and sales collaterals, and code\\nenhancements.\\nSome other organizations are using Generative AI to reimagine an entire\\nactivity. A good example is a client in the construction industry for whom we\\nare using Gen AI to prepare the preliminary architectural plans for a new\\nbuilding project. The AI generated designs are then validated and detailed out\\nby the human team.\\nWe see similar opportunities in product innovation where Generative AI can\\nvisualize multiple new form factors for a product in the manufacturing industry\\nor perhaps new types of packaging in the CPG industry, significantly increasing\\nand accelerating the design process.\\nWhile these are examples of standalone deployment of Generative AI, we are\\nalso beginning to bring larger transformational projects that involve multiple\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 9 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

That is when the\\nmainstream adoption of this technology will really take off and the full potential\\nof this technology will be realized. In the meantime, we continue to invest in\\nbuilding capabilities on this exciting new technology.\\nLast quarter, I had mentioned our plans to train a large number of employees\\non Generative AI. I am happy to inform you that we now have a 100,000-strong\\nGen AI ready cohort and our focus now is on further deepening their expertise.\\nGoing beyond skilling and certifications, we are launching an AI Playground\\nthat will be an alternative work environment where TCSers can safely and\\nsecurely access various Generative AI platforms and a curated set of startup\\ntechnologies from our COIN or co-innovation network partners.\\nThis will give them the hands-on experience of experimenting with large\\nlanguage models, trying out new ideas and building out solutions to real-life\\nbusiness problems without exposing data in our network. Over time, we plan\\nto hold hackathons in the playground, throwing challenges for TCS’ best and\\nbrightest to solve, using these opportunities to identify the most talented\\nengineers within the organization and nurture their talent.\\nOur various product and platform teams are working towards leveraging\\nGenerative AI to create differentiating capabilities in their respective products.\\nignio, our flagship AIOps product, has been at the forefront of leveraging AI to\\ndrive autonomous operations.\\nThe latest enhancement to its knowledge accelerator module leverages large\\nlanguage models to extract information from various sources, create a\\ncomprehensive enterprise context, and gain a deeper understanding of each\\norganization's unique environment, challenges, and objectives.\\nThis context-aware approach lets ignio optimize automation through situationand technology-specific actions, delivering tailored and efficient solutions that\\nfuel enterprise agility, resiliency, and innovation.

It seems like the IP that you created is something that lets you compete\\nwith the likes of Nokia and Ericsson. Is this understanding correct, or would\\nmost of the IP rest with your partners like Tejas?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nHi Ravi, this is NGS here. TCS is a system integrator in this opportunity. For\\nthe EPC core software, the IP lies with our partner, C-DOT. The Radio Access\\nNetwork is developed and designed by Tejas Networks, and the IP rests with\\nTejas Networks. There are a few other things that are required for integrating\\nthe software. For all the network optimization, network planning, cognitive\\nnetwork operations, some of those are traditionally done by the SI. We have\\nbuilt those platforms. The IP of those components is with TCS.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nGreat. Thank you. We have historically been used to, as investors, perhaps\\nunfairly comparing your with Accenture's outsourcing, that division is what we\\nthought that TCS most compares to. But now with your focus on growth and\\ntransformation, should we think about a larger part of TCS revenues being\\nexposed to a segment closer to Accenture's consulting?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 13 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nNo, I don't want to compare it like that. I think we are focused on multiple types\\nof engagements and cost and optimization, growth and transformation is a\\nbroad categorization. I think consulting is typically included as a part of every\\ngrowth and transformation opportunity. There are certain verticals and certain\\ncustomer segments where we have really built a lot of expertise. In those\\nengagements, I think what you alluded to, may be true.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nOne last follow-up on the BSNL deal. There are news reports quoting this deal\\nat `15,000 crores. So the number that you're putting out, $1 billion seems to\\nbe just about half of that. So is this just phase 1 of the program?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nWhat we have contracted so far with BSNL is this. But there are things like\\nfollow-up activities on some of this, like for example, annual maintenance. It\\nwill come as we progress this. Overall deal size is something larger because\\nmultiple things are there. But currently what we have contracted is for the\\nsupply, installation, commissioning, design and optimization of the network.\\nThat is the one that we talked about, a little over $1 billion.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nPerfect. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from\\nInvestec. Please go ahead.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nGood evening and thanks for the opportunity. Just wanted some color on the\\ndemand, overall. So if you see the last three quarters, including this one, our\\nbook-to-bill has been consistently above 1.4. However the revenue accretion\\nis soft. So just want to hear your thoughts on how one should think about this?\\nThe second is you did mention that reprioritization and cutting discretionary\\nhas been sort of driving revenue headwinds. Do you get the feel that this is sort\\nof at its peak and it's -- are you seeing signs of this abating in terms of the\\noverall impact on the existing book of business, right? So those are the two\\nquestions.\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nNitin, last quarter also we explained the situation. On the one hand, our\\ncustomers continue to entrust us the building of new technology capabilities\\nand based on that, we continue to win new deals. But at the same time, given\\nthe overall market uncertainty, they are trying to conserve cash and optimize\\ntheir current spend, particularly on projects that have been running for long.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 14 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nAlso, sometimes such projects end, and we may not have sufficient\\nreplacement of those revenue streams. So this is causing the revenue growth\\nto moderate. Like you said the reprioritization is also a factor into that like a\\nlarge project may get reprioritized into smaller chunks or maybe slowed down.\\nAll these factors are at play, but how long this will last is not a question that we\\ncan answer at this time.\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nSure, and just one last thing is how do you see furloughs? Are there any\\nconversations on furloughs? Do you think, are you seeing any signs to suggest\\nit's going to be normal, or…\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nOur planning is based on the belief that it will be normal like every other year.\\nWe don't see any difference.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nFair enough. Thank you so much and all the very best.\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nThanks, Nitin.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Kumar Rakesh from\\nBNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\n\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nHi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Krithi, my question was\\naround the revenue side. If you see over the last three quarters, our revenue\\nin absolute terms have largely been steady, while at the same time, our deal\\nwin has accelerated, now crossing consistently $10 billion.\\nSo that is fair to expect that the incremental new part of the revenue within that\\nabout $7.2 billion of revenue, the new part would be more sizable now. That\\nimplies that the underlying impact of the existing project rampdowns or\\nreprioritization which we're talking about sequentially is increasing. Is that\\ninference correct?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nMathematically, what you're saying is correct. There is an increasing\\nreprioritization of long running projects.\\nThere are a few places where a large program may have come to an end. For\\ninstance, in Germany we're doing a large integration. Once the integration of\\nthe two banks came to an end, that was a large revenue stream that stopped,\\nand not replaced by something else.\\nSo both are possible. There is an increased focus on cost optimization, which\\nis causing our revenues not to increase in line with the increase in TCV.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 15 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nGot it. My second question was for Samir. So in the second quarter after the\\nwage hike, our margin improvement has been ahead of what historically we\\nhave done, at least in the recent past. And you did talk about that these cutting\\ndown on the discretionary expenditures now picking up pace and scale. Should\\nwe expect that our margin recovery trajectory should be ahead of what we have\\nseen, say, last year or in the past years?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nI think two points. First, we are happy with what we were able to deliver in Q2,\\na 110 basis point sequential improvement. Given the current macro uncertainty\\nimpacting top line, it's fairly decent. Our focus will be to use the existing levers,\\nthat is, productivity, utilization and further optimizing subcontractor expenses\\nto continue the journey. And if growth returns, it will only help accelerate this\\njourney.\\n\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nGot it, thanks a lot.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Sudheer Guntupalli from\\nKotak Mahindra AMC. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nYes, good evening. Thanks for the opportunity. NGS, sir, just one clarification\\non your characterization of the BSNL deal. When you say you're looking to\\ncomplete the project in 12 months to 18 months, is it the entire $1 billion TCV\\nwill be converted into revenue over the next 12 to 18 months? Or is there any\\nsizable part of the $1 billion TCV which is also structured as network\\nmaintenance revenue over a longer horizon?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nWhen I said the 12 to 18 months, the rollout of the 4G and 5G network for\\n100,000 network sites is what we will install, we will commission. And\\nafterwards, you know, we hope to win the maintenance and network operations\\neffort, which will be for optimizing the network and continuously modernizing it.\\nIn the payment terms with BSNL, there are certain clear milestones. Of the $1\\nbillion that we have put in place, a part of it will definitely mature within these\\n12 to 18 months. Some part of it will be subject to warranty and acceptance by\\nBSNL and things like that. Overall, it's safe to assume that a good part of this\\n$1 billion is something that we would like to bill and collect from BSNL within\\n12 to 18 months’ time.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nUnderstood, sir. So any maintenance will be probably a subsequent phases,\\nany maintenance revenue will be subsequently...\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 16 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nAbsolutely. It could be subsequently or it could be even concurrent. For\\nexample, at the end of the six months, if we have completed one zone\\nconsisting of a few circles, then we might go ahead and contract the annual\\nmaintenance, etcetera, specifically for that circle.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nUnderstood, sir. Thanks for that. And Krithi, we know it's difficult to second\\nguess the macro and sorry for persisting on this aspect. But given you have\\nseen these clients over, let's say, multiple decades, multiple macro cycle, any\\nspecific macro events, outcomes, time lines or variables these clients are\\nlooking forward to now, post which they may sort of bite the bullet and move\\nforward in terms of spending and ramping up the deals?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nSudheer, they are probably looking for some very definitive signs of economic\\nrecovery. Currently, the CY 23 outlook, and some people are extending it to\\nCY 24 also, is uncertain. Once they have a definitive sign of recovery I think\\nthe confidence will come into the market. Until then, this will continue.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nSure sir. And lastly, to Milind, so the headcount reduction we have seen is\\npurely because of the fact that we have not fully replaced the normal attrition\\nduring the quarter. Is that a fair assessment, sir?\\n\\nMilind Lakkad:\\n\\nYes, that is a fair assessment.\\n\\nSudheer Guntupalli:\\n\\nThank you, sir. All the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Sandeep Shah from\\nEquirus Securities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nYes, thanks. Thanks for the opportunity. So, just a question in terms of this\\ncommentary about -- there is a conservatism on discretionary spend and the\\ncost takeout deals are increasing, outsourcing deals are increasing, vendorconsolidation deals are increasing. This is almost happening in the sector,\\nincluding for TCS for last two to three quarters.\\nSo, is it fair to say these deals may start ramping up in the second half and\\nwhich will try to actually reduce the impact of the leaking bucket, and there\\ncould be some gradual turnaround in the revenue? Is it the right way of looking\\nat it?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 17 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nSandeep, all the deals are yielding the revenue as per plan. We have not had\\ndelays in the revenue conversion on the deals we have signed. So there is no\\nchange there. Whether H2 will be stronger than H1, I cannot comment on that.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nOkay. Okay. And just another question to CFO, sir. In terms of margins, how\\nto look at second half margin? Generally, we do well on a Q-on-Q basis across\\nfrom Q2 to Q4. But this year, in the second half, we will also have some\\nheadwind coming through BSNL deal and what I believe the $1 billion deal will\\nhave a thin margin. So directionally, still one you can expect, despite that\\nheadwind, which would be incremental where margin can still go up on a Qon-Q?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nAs you rightly pointed out, usually we have been taking our biggest headwind\\nin the first quarter, and we gradually claw back. In a typical year where it's\\nsupported by growth, we get a higher leverage from growth, also helping us on\\nthe margin front. In the first two quarters, we have seen the top line being\\nsluggish.\\nBut at least in Q2, we have been able to deliver the 110 basis points. And\\ncollectively, we have been focused on specific initiatives, which have helped\\nus deliver this. And as I said in response to the last question, we'll try to use\\nthe same levers and continue the journey.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nOkay. This would be despite the BSNL headwind, which could be there on\\nmargins?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nWe manage margins at an overall portfolio level, and don’t call out deal-specific\\nheadwinds.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nOkay, okay. Thanks and all the best.\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Vibhor Singhal from\\nNuvama Equities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nYes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. So sir, a couple of questions from my\\nside. In terms of the vertical performance that we are looking at, Retail\\ncontinues to be quite weak, I think, for multiple quarters. What is the outlook\\non that segment? Are we seeing any signs that spending might come back in\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 18 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\na quarter or two? Or what are the client conversations in the overall retail\\nsegment specifically? And then I have a follow-up question.\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nSo, on the retail segment, your observation is correct. Like it's been a tough\\nquarter. But see, on a year-on-year basis, retail segment has grown marginally.\\nBut this quarter has been tough because we are seeing that even the essential\\nspending has also come down. Normally -- essential with a strong sector for\\nus. This time even essential has been quite weak.\\nWe need to see like, as I was mentioning before, once the consumer spending\\npicks up, all these things will bottom out and then we'll be able to grow. But as\\nI said, I cannot call it when it will turn, but it's been, as I said, multiple subverticals within retail have been weak, like essentials normally will be strong,\\nbut this time it's been weak, which has resulted in this weakness.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nSo no signs of conversations with the clients, which could hint that some -their expectations as to what are they looking at?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nAs I was mentioning before, they look at one, what is the forecast for the\\ncoming quarter if they expect there's a certainty on growth or they look at what\\nis the projection on spending.\\nOnce one of these two comes back, the retail sector will also start investing.\\nCurrently while the spending is still reasonably high, household savings in US\\nhave come down which is creating some sort of uncertainty. So, but there could\\nbe a holiday season optimization also. So we will get to see when some of\\nthese macros turn positive, we'll see more of the growth indication coming in.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nGot it, got it sir. Also, just one follow up question in terms of just a bookkeeping\\nquestion. What did you mention was the reason for the sharp reduction in\\nheadcount in this quarter?\\n\\nMilind Lakkad:\\n\\nWe have been investing in fresh talent for almost 18 months and that\\ninvestment is now paying off. And as a result, and also because of lower\\nattrition, we kind of recalibrated our gross hiring and those numbers are less\\nthan our attrition. And hence, there's a net reduction.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nGot it, got it. And do we expect this thing to maybe continue? Because I mean,\\nattrition is, I think, easing off further. And so do we believe this headcount\\nreduction will continue for some time? Or do you think it could stabilized in the\\ncoming quarters?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 19 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nMilind Lakkad:\\n\\nWe will continue to look at all the other parameters including growth and based\\non that, make the calls. I expect the numbers to be, may not be this high or\\nmaybe similar or may be little more than zero - in that range in the coming\\nquarters.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nGot it sir. Thank you so much for taking my questions and wish you all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Abhishek Kumar from\\nJM Financial. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nHi, good afternoon and thanks for taking our question. I have a question on\\ndeal wins. I know, you mentioned that the quarterly run rate has gone up from\\n$7 billion to $10 billion. Just wanted to understand, given that the contribution\\nof the deal now is more cost take out. How should we look at ACV of the deal?\\nAny color Has the ACV also gone up in-line with improvement in TCV or there\\nis any difference in ACV?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nThere is no specific call-out on that. I think that ACV has remained similar to\\nwhat it was before. I don't think the deal tenure has significantly increased. It's\\nmore or less same as before.\\n\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nOkay. My next question is on Gen AI. I was just wondering about the\\ninvestments that we are doing or many of our peers are doing in Gen AI. There\\ndoesn't seem to be any margin headwind. Essentially, it looks like we are\\nreprioritizing our own budgets for investing in Gen AI. Is it something that\\nclients are also kind of creating investments in Gen AI in a similar fashion? And\\ntherefore, it is at best kind of a net neutral from a demand perspective?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nI think it's safe to assume that it is neutral, primarily because I think we are in\\nan investment cycle like our clients. We as a company are also investing a lot\\nin training our employees, in creating learning platforms and you know\\nseparate environment, like we talked about the AI Playground, which we\\nlaunched, in which we are making available all the digital infrastructure tools\\nand technology in which people can train and people can actually develop\\nthings, right? And get used to how this particular technology works and that\\ncan be meaningfully deployed to our clients.\\nThere's a lot of investment happening outside. Our clients also invest in the\\ntechnology to do small projects, proof-of-concepts, a proof-of-values and then\\nstructure typical use case and so on and so on. We also invested in cataloguing\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 20 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nseveral use cases by verticals and by technology to see how this particular\\ntechnology can meaningfully deliver value on a sustainable basis.\\nSo I think in all that, there is demand, but I wouldn't rate it to be very high. But\\nI would say that look, I think all directions indicate that this is something that\\nwill mature and the potential for embedding it and embracing it all across our\\nIT services value chain is huge.\\nAbhishek Kumar:\\n\\nGreat. That was helpful. Thank you and all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Gaurav Rateria from\\nMorgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nHi, thank you for taking my question. So the first question, again, coming to\\nrevenue. There are multiple moving parts, which is inflow of new work, project\\ncompletions and reprioritization of existing book. But if we were to just look at\\nonly the inflow of the new order wins, would it be fair to believe that inflow\\nnumber should be better in the second half compared to first half based on the\\ndeals that we have already reported?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nYes, the inflow should continue to improve from the new order wins. That’s a\\nfair assessment.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nSecondly are there anything to call out with respect to any unusual project\\ncompletions, which are scheduled in second half which is keeping your\\noptimism under check? I understand the leakage part of the business, but just\\ntrying to understand any project completions, which also could be one of the\\nreasons for keeping your optimism under check?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nGaurav, nothing material that comes to our mind. In fact project completions\\nwill take place in the normal course, but nothing very material that comes to\\nmind.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nGot it. Last question on the margin levers front, how much more room we may\\nhave on the utilization and productivity metrics. Those would still continue to\\nbe levers in the near term in 3Q, 4Q point of view? Thank you.\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nYes, Gaurav. Those will continue to be levers. We invested significantly when\\nthe supply environment was challenging. And utilization as well as some flab\\nsitting on the direct cost itself, are levers. So all of it, which you mentioned, that\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 21 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nOctober 11, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\nis, productivity, utilization and in the given environment, the subcontractor\\ncosts also, continue to be levers in Q3 and Q4.\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Moshe Katri from\\nWedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Mr. Moshe Katri you may please\\nproceed with your question. As there is no response, we'll move to the next\\nquestion from the line of Rahul Jain from Dolat Capital. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRahul Jain:\\n\\nYes, hi. Thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to understand little bit on the\\nrationale of reassigning this regional markets and others segment. What is left\\nout of here because it seems the same vertical, which has been losing some\\ncomponent into this line item has again gained back in a similar fashion. So\\nwhich region do we ascribe to and what is left now?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nRahul, we wanted to give you all a global color of what is happening in a given\\nindustry vertical rather than splitting them into regions. So as much as possible,\\nwherever revenue streams are stable and mature, we put them under the\\nindustry vertical. And where there's still a lot of volatility, we continue to keep\\nin Regional Markets and Others.\\nWith that, we have moved our APAC and EMEA region revenues into the\\nrespective industry verticals. We continue to keep India, Public Services,\\nJapan and Products & Platforms in the Regional Markets and Others line. It's\\nto ensure that we can give you more global color at the industry level.\\n\\nRahul Jain:\\n\\nOkay. So what I understood is that India, Japan and product and platform is\\nbroadly the component in this at this point?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nExactly, in the regional market. Yes.\\n\\nRahul Jain:\\n\\nYes. And just a small extension to that, if we see over a period of time, our\\ncontribution from Asia, Middle East, Africa, the market which you called out\\nhave come off over last six years, while the contribution in this period has\\nincreased for Europe as an end market. So does that also mean that are very\\nlarge portion of P&P implied -- would it be Japan and Europe?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\n:\\n\\nNo, I didn't get the last part, Rahul?\\n\\nPage 22 of 24\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We are not breaking those out into respective segments,\\nbut every component has grown. P&P has grown, Japan has grown but not\\nP&P in Japan.\\n\\nRahul Jain:\\n\\nYes, I understand. Probably I'll take it offline. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen that was the last question for today. I now hand the\\nconference over to the management for the closing comments. Over to you,\\nsir.\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nThank you, operator.\\nIn Q2 our revenue grew 7.9% in Rupee terms and 2.8% in constant currency\\nterms. Our growth was affected by the holding back of discretionary spends by\\nclients.\\nImproved utilization, productivity and other efficiencies helped expand our\\noperating margin by 110 basis points sequentially to 24.3%. Our net margin is\\nat 19%.\\nGenerative AI continues to drive client conversations. We have hundreds of\\nopportunities in the pipeline and embedding Generative AI solutions is helping\\nus win large deals. We continue to invest in building our capabilities. We now\\nhave over 100,000 Generative AI-ready employees and are investing in\\nbuilding differentiated capabilities within Generative AI in our portfolio of awardwinning products and platforms.\\nDeal momentum continued to be very strong in Q2, with our order book at\\n$11.2 billion, the second highest TCV ever.\\nOn the people front, we continue to have the right talent, but have recalibrated\\nour grass hiring to ensure better utilization of our existing capacity. Our LTM\\nattrition in IT services fell further to 14.9%.\\nLastly, our Board has recommended a second interim dividend of `9 per share\\nand also a share buyback to a tune of `17,000 crore at `4,150 per share.\\nWith that, we wrap up our call today.

We don't see a major problem there. So, to\\nsome extent, it depends on the industry also, Apurva.\\n\\nApurva Prasad:\\n\\nOkay. And my other question for Samir, on the operational front, what are some\\nof the near-term levers that you have, especially when operating leverage\\nimpact is lower due to softer growth?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nSure. We will continue to use levers like utilization. I have called out that\\nutilization still has scope for further improvement and it continues to have.\\nProductivity and realization become the other levers. And some of our\\ndiscretionary spend is now at a critical mass, where we can start looking at\\noptimizing them as well. So, these would be the primary levers.\\n\\nApurva Prasad:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal\\nOswal Financial Services. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nThank you. A couple of questions from my side. Krithi, first on the nature of\\npauses which you guys have started seeing. What are you hearing from your\\nclients in terms of what are the signs they are looking for which can make them\\nchange their view on these pauses or kind of pushouts? Is this something\\nwhich people will still have patience for some time before they start pulling back\\ntheir tech spending or do you think the uncertainty being where it is, if things\\ndon't worsen materially, the demand can come back on a shorter notice?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nSo, Mukul, as you also mentioned, it is a near-term uncertainty which is causing\\nthe clients to re-look at the programs and pause them wherever they think the\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 15 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nROI is not strong or is going to take longer time. And once the uncertainty is\\nlifted, and they have clarity on more long-term outlook in terms of where there\\nwill be growth or what they should be doing, we would see a certain class of\\nprojects, either cost optimization or transformation projects picking up\\nmomentum.\\nBut obviously, we cannot say when the uncertainty will be cleared. So, I would\\nbelieve that till the uncertainty exists, there would be a cautionary approach\\ntowards investments.\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nSure. Krithi, one question on the Gen AI. Obviously, you spoke a lot about it,\\nbut how should we realistically expect to see the impact of all the work you are\\ndoing from a two to three-year window? Is this something which will help you\\naccelerate your revenue growth or should we see this more as a defensive\\nmove which will help you defend your revenues because there is a bit of a\\ndeflationary nature to the Gen AI deployment? Or is this something which will\\nplay out more on the talent side and structurally moderate the pace of people\\naddition?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nMukul, this is NGS here. I think all of the things that you said will play out. You\\nneed to be looking at all these dimensions. But I think what is interesting for us\\nis the fact that it can deliver things faster and the whole time-to-market element\\ncould be completely redefined. Newer benchmarks could emerge in terms of\\npredictability of the overall software, quality, processes, everything can\\nimprove.\\nWill it mean that we will need less people? It is something that we will have to\\nevaluate. But in all the technology adoptions in the past that we have seen, it\\nhas only increased the volume of work and thereby actually we needed more\\nexpertise and more hands to do the heavy lifting that people really look for.\\nSo from that perspective, it is a very interesting technology. And a lot of\\nevaluations are going on at the enterprise level. And the other thing is that,\\nlook, the whole cost model of it, how much is it going to cost me to embrace\\nGenerative AI? How are people going to price it? It is a very interesting\\nproposition that everybody is looking at.\\nCurrently, every token is getting priced. So how much is it going to cost me to\\nembrace Generative AI in my overarching things that I want to accomplish\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 16 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nacross technology and operation is also something that will be taken and\\nplayed out.\\nSo I see a lot of opportunities for us in structuring our own way of delivery, our\\nown improvement to the value propositions that we can offer embedding\\nGenerative AI. But overall, it’s going to be very interesting to see how industries\\nare going to embrace it and given their own experience on cloud and the angst\\naround how the cloud cost itself in terms of consumption cost is emerging.\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nSure. Thanks a lot for taking the question and best of luck for the remainder of\\nthe year.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Kumar Rakesh from\\nBNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\n\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nHi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just an extension of the\\ngenerative AI discussion, we were having just now. So while you definitely\\ntalked a lot about the demand opportunity for the customers, I understand, you\\nare also running multiple projects internally as well, to assess AI augmented\\nprocesses, how they are going to save cost or productivity for you. Can you\\nshare some of the details on that? And is that a possibility that, our own\\nproductivity benefits within TCS could start to prove much ahead of the\\nrevenue opportunity from generative AI comes through, eventually?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nRakesh, this is NGS again. It’s difficult to call out some of this, but sufficient to\\nsay that, we have multiple teams, in almost every vertical that we have, who\\nare working on pilots and internal projects. We are also working on how to craft\\nthe methodologies and toolkits to be meaningful to our clients, using this\\ntechnology. All this is going on.\\nAnd as we called out earlier, there are at least about 50 projects that we are\\nexecuting. Some are small, some are large. And one of the nice things to see\\nis , if a particular organization has an ability to predict one or two parameters,\\nthat can be focused upon using this technology, that will create maximum\\nbusiness impact for them.\\nI mentioned about, for example, if someone can predict, if the technology can\\npredict let us say, the container price three quarters down the line, then it could\\nbe a boon for the shipping industry. So, it is a problem such as that, and how\\ndo you improve or increase the yield per acre of agricultural commodities,\\nright?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 17 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nSome of these things and specifically matching with the climate technologies\\nor climate parameters that one has, which will have their own predictive\\nfeatures, will all contribute to inter-disciplinary nature of the solutions that we\\nneed to deliver. So, there is a lot of work going on in the industry and within the\\nresearch and innovation team of TCS. A couple of quarters down the line,\\nmaybe we will be able to give you more color.\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nThanks a lot, NGS, for that. Definitely quite exciting use cases there. Samir,\\nduring media interaction, you talked about clawing back some of the margin in\\nthe coming quarters. So, how do you see the trajectory of the claw-back? Will\\nit be similar to what we saw last year or there are higher tailwinds or headwinds\\nthis year as we move in the coming quarters?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nSo, in a typical year for us, we take the biggest headwind, which is the\\nincrement up front. We then typically claw back the margins through the rest\\nof the year. With the current macro uncertainties, it would be difficult to estimate\\nhow exactly the margin recovery will play out quarter on quarter. But our focus\\nwould be to incrementally get closer to our aspirational band, improving our\\nmargins through each of the quarters and exit at a higher rate at the end of the\\nyear.\\n\\nKumar Rakesh:\\n\\nGot it. Thank you, Samir.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Gaurav Rateria from\\nMorgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. I have a few. Firstly, let us know if the\\nunderstanding is correct. You entered 1Q with softness owing to events that\\nplayed out in the month of March, especially in the US on banking side. And\\nthen you built momentum through the quarter to deliver what you delivered. Is\\nit fair to say that you are entering the next quarter 2Q with slightly better\\nmomentum and better visibility than you did in the last quarter?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nGaurav, that is very difficult to say. I do not want to venture into saying\\nsomething like we have better visibility, better momentum at this time. I would\\nsay, it has been very similar to what we saw in March. I wish, I can could say\\nthat, we are in a much better place, but I do not want to give that optimism at\\nthis time.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 18 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nAll right. Second question. Around two very strong quarters of TCV, now based\\non the deal ramp schedule, does this provide you with greater visibility of\\nsecond half versus first half?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nNo. Our second half would depend on what happens in Q2 and how the\\nmomentum further builds over that. So, I do not believe that we are ready to\\ncall that second half is going to be better than first half. It is too early at this\\ntime.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nAll right. Last question. Any particular investments on the consulting side to\\nleverage the demand that you think from generative AI projects? As you talked\\nabout that, a lot of organizations want to go to the consulting mode and not\\nlook at necessarily on a silo basis. And also investments on the delivery side,\\nwhich could help you to benefit from this technology? Thank you.\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nGaurav, as we mentioned, we are approaching it from multiple angles. We are\\nbuilding our in-house capability in Gen AI. We have our R&I team that is\\nworking on developing patents and very unique capabilities. We are leveraging\\nour contextual masters, because we want to marry the technology capability\\nwith the domain capability delivery services.\\nWe are striking partnerships with all the hyperscalers. Coming to training, we\\nare committed to train 100,000 of our associates to be capable of leveraging\\nthis technology. So, all these are investments. In terms of any other\\ninvestment, we also constantly look for new partnerships and other kinds of\\ninvestment. As something comes up, we will definitely go forward and make\\nthose investments.\\nBut, at this time, our investments are more in terms of ensuring our associates\\nand our contextual masters and domain experts work together, to think of the\\nright use cases and the right solutions for our customers.\\n\\nGaurav Rateria:\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Ravi Menon from\\nMacquarie. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nMy question is about fresher hiring. So was there any fresher hiring this quarter\\nor was the recruitment mostly lateral to backfill that ?\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 19 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nNo. We continue to hire freshers and we'll hire this quarter as well and that will\\ncontinue.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nMy next question is on last quarter's increase in onsite costs and whether that\\nwas due to new project starts. Have we continued to see new projects start this\\nquarter and that got offset by some pressure on the book of existing business?\\nOr we didn't really see any new project starts and cater it, that's why we kind\\nof ended flat quarter-on-quarter on CC terms?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nWe saw new project starts with deal wins continuing to ramp up. We also had\\nonsite movements happening incrementally in this quarter as well. And the net\\nimpact on revenue is due to the uncertainty on the existing projects or\\ncustomers pausing their spend.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nLet me ask one more follow-up from me on this deferral of contracts. Is this\\ndue to this whole change in model to Agile versus Waterfall? Is that causing\\npeople to be able to take this pause versus earlier you would really have for\\nany deliverable, there would be months probably still to go. So you couldn't\\nreally halt everything mid-flight and now it makes it a lot easier to put these\\npauses?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nNot necessarily. I don't think I want to attach the reason to any methodology.\\nIt is more related to customers’ business outlook, However, in Agile\\nengagements we execute smaller chunks of work at a time so to that extent,\\nyou can say that it is easier for customers to defer the next phase of work.\\nOtherwise, it has little to do with the project delivery methodology.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThanks and best of luck.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Rahul Jain from Dolat\\nCapital. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRahul Jain:\\n\\nYes. Thanks for the opportunity. Firstly on the regional market side, we have\\nseen that, one-third of the contribution on a TTM basis has come from this\\nsegment, where the profitability is lower by 400 bps versus company average.\\nAnd some of the large deals in India market that we know like BSNL and GM\\nprobably may not have higher margins. So you think this segment growth,\\nfaster growth would put further pressure on profitability in the coming period?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nIt is something that we will have to work on. But, these are fundamentally large\\nprograms, large system integration opportunities. And if you really look at the\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 20 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\noverall deals that we have signed, one is that the $10.2 billion TCV does not\\ninclude the BSNL deal, number one. Number two is that the platform deals, it\\nhas the potential to improve margins, if we execute it well and we deliver it on\\ntime and stick to the model in which, we want to continue to charge the\\ncustomer on a SaaS basis, the opportunity is there to grow well.\\nAnd it is also based on certain things like price based on policy or claim that\\nwe settled and so on. So it has the potential to create a pricing structure which\\nwill increase our margins as opposed to only diluting the margin in some of\\nthese cases. But traditionally, if you take large system integration projects\\nwhere we end up delivering some amount of hardware, yes, there the margin\\nmaybe less than the company average margin.\\nBut overall, you have to see these as large opportunities for long-term value\\ncreation with those customers. So it is a combination that we will have to look\\nfor. On a net-net basis, our approach is to take some of these projects, execute\\nwell and see that it adds to the overall capability creation and value creation,\\nwhich is consistent with our philosophy.\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nJust one more thing to add, Rahul. We don't publish regional market profitability\\nseparately. If you are looking at segmental results, they are based on industry\\nverticals.\\n\\nRahul Jain:\\n\\nRight. And M&A, if you look at this one growth strategy that we have not\\nleveraged much historically Do you see now is a good time to use either to\\nbuild capability, let's say around Gen AI or maybe scale up opportunities from\\ncaptive transaction as many corporations are looking for resource\\noptimizations?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nRahul, our approach does not change. We have always looked at M&A if we\\nhave to augment some capability that we didn't have internally, and if we\\nthought that by acquiring a company, we'll be able to further expand our\\nservices to a larger set of our customers. So we keep looking at it.\\nWhenever we find there's a good opportunity, big or small, we would go for it.\\nBut our overall strategy doesn't change, whether it's Gen AI or the whole cloud.\\nWhenever there is an opportunity, we go for it. It has to meet our criteria and\\nthreshold.\\n\\nRahul Jain:\\n\\n:\\n\\nRight. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\\n\\nPage 21 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We have our next question from the line of Vibhor Singhal from\\nNuvama Equities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nYes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Krithi, just one question from my side\\non the two segments that we have seen quite contrasting performance in the\\npast few quarters. So manufacturing has held up quite well for us. And not just\\nfor us, for all the companies across the industry. It's been quite stable in terms\\nof growth. Even in this quarter, we almost have double digit growth on a Y-onY basis.\\nSo what is keeping this spend up in the manufacturing segment? And are we\\nnot facing the kind of delays that we are facing in, let's say, BFSI or other\\nverticals, in the manufacturing segment? And do you think that manufacturing\\nmight continue to remain stable in the coming quarters as well?\\nAnd a similar kind of opinion about retail. So in retail, we had seen a lot of\\nweakness in the past couple of quarters. And again, not just for us, for the\\nentire industry. Are there any signs of that segment bottoming out? If not today,\\nmaybe in a couple of quarters' time? Just a little bit color on these two verticals?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nI would say manufacturing is doing well because of the low base and the\\ndelayed pickup in demand and growth compared to other industries. And as\\nthe supply chain situation also eases slowly, customers are able to see the\\ngrowth. Today you see the demand is still high for many of the automakers. I\\nthink that's probably driving it. And again, I won't be able to say how long this\\nwill last because it will eventually be a function of the overall economy.\\nOn Retail, our view is, or what we see, the essential retail is doing well. But if\\nit is luxury or fashion or other specialty retail, we find that there is a softness in\\ndemand in such sub-segments of the industry. So that's a broad color that we\\ncan provide you on these two verticals.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nGot it. And on the manufacturing part, just a follow-up. Is it only the auto part\\nof the manufacturing segment appearing stable at this point of time and looking\\nto continue to spend? Or are the other sub-verticals in manufacturing also kind\\nof stable?\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nNo, we don't provide that detailed color. I think, excepting one, quite a few of\\nthe sub-verticals are doing well. And our outlook may not even apply for the\\noverall industry, as we also have significant market share gain in this segment,\\nwhich is also driving our growth.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 22 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nGot it. Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I wish you all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP\\nMorgan. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAnkur Rudra:\\n\\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just the first question, a bit on the\\ndemand, maybe one more time. Krithi, of course, you've seen over your long\\ntime at TCS several demand cycles over the last 30 plus years. Is it possible\\nto compare the current client behavior to any of the prior periods, such as\\nperhaps post dotcom or GFC or taper tantrum or anything? Or is it completely\\nnovel? That's question number one.\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nI don't know if I can compare with any other cycle in the past. Every cycle has\\nits own nuances. I would say today the way to look at the environment, there\\nis an uncertainty because of which customers are reviewing or assessing the\\nongoing programs. At the same time, there is so much they realize that they\\nhave to do because there is so much of technology debt within each one of\\nthose industries.\\nAnd unless they carry out those transformative programs, they'll have a\\ncompetitive disadvantage. So these two things are at play. So that's the\\nreason, we keep saying that while the TCV is high, we do see softness in the\\nshort-term revenue.\\nI don't know whether, we can compare or again, I'm not sure what is the value\\nyou get in comparing also, Ankur. Like today, the reality is, long term, this\\ntechnology spend has to happen. Short term, the customers are navigating the\\nuncertainty there.\\n\\nAnkur Rudra:\\n\\nOkay. I was just looking for if there is any historical path we can compare with.\\nBut fair enough. Thank you for the comment. Maybe moving to the Generative\\nAI side of the discussion. Thank you for all the color today. I'm just curious if\\nyou think Gen AI would be a needle mover on revenues either for this year or\\nthe next. And if it is showing up in contract discussions at all, maybe as a\\nsource of price aggression in cost takeout deals?\\n\\nN G Subramaniam:\\n\\nI don't know. It is not showing that much as being a differentiated feature in our\\ncontract discussions. But, you know, everybody is curious about its value. And\\nif you really look at, the investments that large enterprises are making as they\\nmove to a cloud native architecture, there is an intelligence layer in the overall\\narchitecture.\\n\\n:\\n\\nPage 23 of 25\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call\\nJuly 12, 2023, 19:00 hrs IST (09:30 hrs US ET)\\n\\nGiven the power of Generative AI or its potential, there have been efforts from\\neverybody to see whether the architecture that has been put in place is\\nconsistent with the capabilities or potential offered by Generative AI, whether\\nsuch architecture need to be tweaked. So that is the kind of discussion we are\\nhaving.\\nThere is always a question around, to explain, how much of this Generative AI\\ncapability needs to be developed at the enterprise level in-house and keep the\\nknowledge and the learnings in-house and how much of it can go outside for\\nits larger public cost is a debate. And that's consistent with the debate that\\npeople used to have earlier in terms of private cloud versus public cloud.\\nSo all these discussions, I think, you know, will happen for the next at least a\\nfew quarters. Then there will be, a meaningful conditional, unconditional model\\nthat will emerge. That will get embraced by the larger enterprises is what I see,\\nas evolving. It's purely my personal view.\\nAnkur Rudra:\\n\\nI appreciate that. One last question on contract profitability. How is that\\nprogressing? I realize that, gross margins have continued to take a hit,\\nprobably due to wage hikes this time. But if you look at the full year in FY‘24, I\\nknow you expect margins to be clawed back. But do you think there is any\\nchance that margins on a full year basis might actually not expand in FY‘24 or\\nmight even decline despite the supply easing up?\\n\\nSamir Seksaria:\\n\\nAnkur, all our efforts collectively will be towards improving margins. But right\\nnow, given the current macro, it's difficult to give a color in terms of how it would\\nend up exactly. Rest assured all efforts are going towards improving the\\nmargins.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now\\nhand the conference over to the management for closing comments.\\n\\nK Krithivasan:\\n\\nThank you, operator.

Before we open this to Q&A\\nsession.\\nSriram Khattar:\\n\\nThanks, Vivek. It gives me a lot of pleasure to share with all of you that the U.S. Green Business\\nCouncil at the annual expo recognized DCCDL and DLF as world leaders in sustainability. And\\nI'll just read out parts of the felicitation that they did there. It says DLF has become the worldwide\\nleader in both LEED zero certifications and LEED for existing buildings platinum-certified\\nspaces, which are extraordinary achievements. It also goes on to say that as the largest public\\nlisted real estate company in India, your actions and leaderships are influential and inspirational.\\nYou are setting a standard for sustainability, excellence to which others may aspire.\\nI am honoured to recognize you're creating a sustainable build environment in the Greenbuild\\nInternational Conference and Expo. U.S. Green Business Council could not be prouder to work\\nwith a global partner like DLF, leading the transformation and LEED generation of the build\\nenvironment across India and throughout the world. I think this was an extraordinary\\nachievement for us recognized by the highest body in sustainability in the world.\\nAnd we continue on our journey on this. We have got the LEED zero for waste certification for\\nour Cyber City in Hyderabad, and now we are replicating it across all our projects. And this is\\nin line with our long-term goals of being leaders. Definitely in India and preferably across the\\nglobe in sustainability.\\n\\nSriram Khattar:\\n\\nThank you, Vivek. Back to you.\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nThanks Sriram. Thank you. Yes, we can open it up for Q&A now.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Anyone who wishes\\nto ask a question, may press star and one on their touch tone telephone. If you wish to remove\\n\\nPage 3 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nyourself from question queue, you may press star and 2. Ladies and Gentlemen, we will wait for\\na while till the question queue assembled. Our first question is from the line of Saurabh Kumar\\nfrom JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nSir congratulations, Team DLF for achieving this positive net cash after guiding for almost 7\\nyears. So seems to be a similar quarter for you guys. So I had a few questions. So 1 is, on\\nCamellias, Aakash, so 14 apartments for INR712 crores. So fair to say that the pricing has now\\ngone to INR70,000 crores, INR75,000 crores, if I just kind of do some back calculation on this\\nunit sales? So that's the first one.\\nThe second is on your cash flow. So our construction spends are still relatively low. Now as your\\nconstruction spends kind of move to the -- and you have 30 million square feet under\\nconstruction, so your construction spend maybe ramp up to maybe INR2,000- crores, INR2,500\\ncrores a year, would you think that your cash flow is now we set still to this INR1100 croresINR1200 crores that you are kind of generating right now? Or is this, in some sense, be cash\\nflow what we're seeing?\\nThe third is essentially just on your debt. Sir, what's the logic of keeping INR3,000 crores of\\ndebt and then INR3,200 crores of cash on balance sheet, that I could not finally figure out? And\\nlastly, one for Mr. Khattar. So it seems to me basis your presentation, you don't have any space\\navailable for marketing in the non-SEZ space in this DCCDL whereas you may have some\\nvacancies SEZ, but the non-SEZ space is not available. So what are your thoughts in terms of\\ngetting that space to market because that's where the demand seems to be? So these are few ones.\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nOkay. So thanks, Saurabh. So in Camellias, we are above the INR75,000, you're right, mark.\\nAnd now, as you know, we've got the last few to go. But I'm sure you would have read the\\nEconomic Times article. So very happy for Gurgaon to have reached that INR100 crore mark\\nfor one apartment. And I think that is something that is obviously everybody is quite excited\\nabout.\\nSo yes, Camellias is upwards of the number that you mentioned. So what you actually mentioned\\nwas the previous pricing and then it's gone up further. It's closer to what was being reported.\\nAnd the only difference being that we have a price difference between lower, mid- and high\\nfloors. So that's where we are with Camellias. And I think we've been part of this journey, so\\nwhere we started to where we are.\\nAnd thankfully, there is -- it's backed by not just speculation, it's backed by solid demand, and\\ntherefore, the new Super luxury product that we were talking about earlier also, where we have\\n-- we've also mentioned about it in our guidance. So based on the services, operations, strong\\ndemand, I'm happy to also mention to you that, today, Camellias has become the benchmark for\\nthe country and very proudly so.\\nSo not only here, but anywhere in the world, when real estate is mentioned, I think Camellias\\ntoday is being deferred as an India product. So I think that is a bigger satisfaction than just\\nreaching INR100 crore mark. So yes, that's where we are, Saurabh.\\n\\nPage 4 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nYes. Saurabh, on the construction spend, first of all, last year, our total spend and annual spends\\nwere close to INR1,200 crores. First half, we spent INR650 crores and the second half, our\\nestimate is we'll be spending close to INR1,000 crores. So on an annualized basis, we'll be\\nspending around INR1,700 crores. Second half, we expect to start giving possessions for a large\\npart of our floors. So that will increase our spending, plus the Arbour project pace is going to\\npick up in the second half.\\nSo there will be a large part of outflow coming up in the second half. The second part of your\\nquestion was cash flow from operations. Yes, in the first half, we have achieved cash flow from\\noperations of INR2,000 crores. And if you remember, the guidance I had given was upwards of\\nINR3,000 crores on an annualized basis. So yes, considering our performance in the first half, I\\nsee an upside in our cash flow operations on a full year basis.\\nThen your other part of the question was what is the logic of keeping INR3,000 crores of gross\\ndebt when we have a cash of INR3,165 crores. Just to remind you that out of INR3,165 crores\\nof cash, the free cash which is available is only INR450 crores. Rest of the cash is not been\\nrealized for accounts, right? So therefore, we'll have to really live with this gross debt till the\\ntime we are able to generate free cash. And we are confident that as we are able to mature our\\nproduct -- projects, and we are able to give OC, right, we'll be able to generate free cash and that\\nwill be utilized to repay the debt.\\n\\nSriram Khattar:\\n\\nSo Saurabh, on your question of space available in non-SEZ, it's with the complete modesty that\\nwe have sort of done well in the last few quarters in terms of leasing. In fact, in downtown in\\nChennai, where there was about 250,000 square feet of space that was left, that was also\\ncommitted yesterday, and therefore, Downtown Chennai is also fully leased. So the space that\\nwe have available now is about 3%, 3.5%, which is about 6 lakh-7 lakh square feet of space. In\\naddition to that, we have some of the hard options, which the tenants may not want to take up,\\nwhich keep coming up, which will get released. And my sense is they will get released at rates\\nwhich are current market rates and higher than the rates at which the hard options were.\\nThree, as we -- our program is to complete Downtown 4 in Gurgaon by the end of '24 -- calendar\\n'24. And in the first quarter of '25, the Atrium Place, which is our joint venture for about 3 million\\nwith Hines in which DLF has 2/3 stake, will start getting completed. So now the leasing and\\noperations teams are working on marketing Atrium Place, and they have a head start of more\\nthan a year before the first building comes up to lease.\\nIn addition, this has also enthused us and we have marginally accelerated the start of construction\\nof Phase 2 in Taramani, which we should start in the Q4 of this financial year. And we are also\\nstarting the construction in the next few weeks on the Phase 2 of Downtown in Gurgaon, which\\nis a multiuse development of about 8 million square feet, 8, 8.5 million square feet, with a 2.7\\nmillion square feet of mall, a destination mall and about 5, 5.5 million square feet of office\\ntowers.\\n\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nThank you, Sir, just 1 follow-up back to the residential side. So I mean how concerned are you\\nabout the sharp price rise you're seeing in Gurgaon? Is there a concern that prices go up too much\\nand then that basically impacts affordability or that's not a concern for you right now?\\n\\nPage 5 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nSo, Saurabh, price is going up, so there is a latent demand. As far as concern is concerned, you're\\nright now referring to the real estate thing for resi but tell me where the prices are not going up,\\nwhether it's eating out in our hotel or an air ticket or even a holiday. So I don't think -- see, right\\nnow, what is going up -- the only thing is that there is a demand for better products and good\\nproducts.\\nSo prices that are going up, if you see this carefully, is going up for products, which are in a\\ncertain genre, so luxury and above. So if the post-COVID what has happened is that the demand\\nand the spends have kind of changed to a certain habit that people have got into in terms of they\\nrealize their life is finite and all that, so therefore, live it up.\\nSo the demand for better, bigger homes is there today. Again, I'm not going to get caught into\\nthis luxury definition and all that, everybody kind of misuse it. But I'm saying better, bigger,\\nmore spacious homes is what the demand is today, and therefore, the price is a resultant of that,\\nSaurabh.\\nSo it is not something which is just something in the air that you're talking about a smaller\\napartment with certain price points. With inflation, with price points going up everywhere, this\\nis where it is today. And buying a residential real estate today has become -- I've repeated this,\\nand I'm going to repeat it again, has become a priority for people to kind of -- it is the number\\none priority today for most of the people.\\nSo thankfully, a lot of people who are in the -- on the fringe and all that and would always live\\non rentals and do other stuff have also jumped into the freight. And I'm talking about the younger\\ncrowd, which is very heartening to see that the 30 to 40 bracket is today making real estate\\npurchases.\\nBut the good part is that they are -- everybody is wanting to fund and take bigger homes. So\\ntherefore, the rise in price points today are a reflection of a certain mindset, which is changing\\non ground, Saurabh. So it is not about speculators, is not about what used to happen 10 years\\nback. These are people who want to buy homes for themselves.\\nAnd if you see the rentals, if you see rentals are a good parameter for what is happening today.\\nAnd also, if you see the habitation charts, there is -- there are various reports in Gurgaon, which\\nwill tell you that most of the condominiums are now over 90%, 95% inhabited.\\nSo I think these are -- this is what you should see. So at this point in time, I wouldn't be concerned\\nabout that. But let's see how it goes. And obviously, things will settle down even further as we\\ngo along. But if you were saying that it's -- all I can say is that there are enough people out there\\nright now who're wanting to better their experiences. And I'm looking at those people. They're\\nnot only just first time -- not only people who are habitual real estate investors, but also a lot of\\nfirst-timers, which is very heartening to see, Saurabh.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Kunal Tayal from Bank of America. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nPage 6 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nKunal Tayal:\\n\\nSure, Thank you. Two questions from my side. There would be about INR19,000 crores worth\\nof launches in the next 6 months. And after which you're largely left to the pipeline of about\\nINR23,000 -INR24,000 crores and it seems like about 1 year's worth of launches of the new base\\n-- is there a thought process already to start planning for the next phase of launches, which should\\ncome by for FY '26 onwards? So that's question number one.\\nThe second one is on the office side. Your IT services tenants have actually been very stable. It's\\nsomething that we've not seen from the peers set. So is there any indication that you have from\\nthem that there is no intention to vacate any existing space?\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nSo the first question is, see, we plan for almost 3 years ahead. And based on which geography\\nwe are getting into and what we are doing. So that, as an exercise, we continue to do internally.\\nSo yes, visibility may be shown for maybe a year or 1.5 years, but we plan 3 years in advance\\nof what we are intending to do. So have been able to answer that question.\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nSo, Kunal, I mean while we have -- we have sort of documented the pipeline or the year after.\\nIt's not that our planning process is sort of shutting down. So we will have a -- I mean, we have\\nenough land bank, and we will have a constant stream of pipeline flowing out.\\n\\nSriram Khattar:\\n\\nKunal, on your question of indication from IT services companies of any vacancy, that has sort\\nof ebbed. And I dare say the impact of COVID is now behind us. This has been helped by 2 or\\n3 -- for 2 or 3 reasons. Reason one is that during COVID, the space take up was for to a lot of\\nexits, and therefore, -- but at the same time, the hiring was very good, and therefore, that is now\\ncoming back in terms of tenants, either not leaving spaces or asking for additional spaces.\\nTwo, what has happened is that some of the larger IT companies are no longer looking at 80\\nsquare feet per desk, etcetera, which had become the norm pre-COVID, and would like to have\\nmore network collaborative open spaces, and therefore, the demand has gone up to 100 and -the size they look at is about 120 to 130 square feet per desk.\\nHowever, having said that, I may add a word of caution here that the companies are still working\\non their individual hybrid models. And that is something which has not yet stabilized. One thing\\nis sure that it's going to be hybrid, but what form or shape the hybrid takes is still being worked\\nout by companies.\\nAnd there are companies who want to hot desk for hybrid. There are others who want to get\\nindividual desks for hybrid. There are others who say, even if it is hybrid, they have to cater\\npeak performance, number one, number two, while attendance in our IT parts has improved\\ndramatically, the larger IT services companies till now have been able to manage the increased\\nmanpower in the existing spaces.\\nAnd last about a quarter or so, we are seeing the green shoots when they have now started\\nplanning for the next year and 2 years and started looking for space. So if this come back to\\noffice starts working in a positive way, and India is far ahead of the west on that, then I see that\\nthe demand from IT services will go up. The issue of vacancy, then we will be in a much more\\nsubdued.\\n\\nPage 7 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nKunal Tayal:\\n\\nPretty encouraging, Thank you so much.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Puneet Gulati from HSBC. Please go ahead.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nThank you so much, Congratulations on good numbers. My first question is on the DevCo's\\ncommercial portfolio, the DLF 5 and City Center. The GAVs there seem to have fallen on a\\nquarter-on-quarter basis. Can you comment what's happened there?\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nGAVs have fallen.\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nSo honestly, the GAVs keep on getting adjusted basis, the rentals. So this time to be fair, on\\nsome of those assets, we have done a very thorough analysis of the of the rentals that have been\\n-- that are not they're just today, but their rentals that those buildings have been earning for the\\nlast 6 or 7 years. And I think that is the reason why the GAVs may have been slightly adjusted.\\nAs you know, -- these numbers have no bearing on the balance sheet or -- on the balance sheet\\nor P&L.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nSir, I know I understand, 20% fall, which is what bothered. So just wondering...\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nSo maybe part of the devil is that the earlier number may have been slightly optimistic. This is\\nthe best that I can say. Because this year -- we've done a very scientific thing of what the rentals\\nare taken a full 9-year cash flow discounted it like a private equity and then come with these\\nnumbers. But again, tomorrow if we to go out to sell it, I'm sure you could get INR50 crores less\\nthan this or INR100 crores more than this, that will be a bilateral coordinate -- bilateral\\nnegotiation. It should not that we are in the market for selling any of these.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nGot it. And second, DCCDL used to give dividend typically in Q2. This time, there was a\\ndividend but very small. Any thought process behind that?\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nNo, Puneet, I think if you go through the cash flow of DCCDL in the last 1 year, DCCDL gave\\na hefty dividend in the end of Q4, which really was a substitute for the final dividend. So hence,\\nthe final dividend was a very small one. DCCDL has again given its half year dividend, but that\\nobviously has come at the end of September, so that's coming early October when the DCCDL\\ndid their second quarter results meeting. So DCCDL continues to be in the cycle to give 2\\ndividends a year, which is what we have been tuned to for the last couple of years.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nOkay. So the cash would come -- would have come in October until September...\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nBecause as you would appreciate that once the first half results are declared, then the company\\ndeclared in time dividend for the last 6 months.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nI understand, thank you so much. And secondly, on the cash tax liability for the DevCo, that\\nseems to be quite low. How long do you think will that advantage persist?\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nCash tax liability?\\n\\nPage 8 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nYes. The cash tax, the cash flow statement.\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nPart of this, Puneet, is linked to the massive change in accounting policy that happened when\\nthe new Ind AS accounting standards got notified growing that sense. So part of this is linked to\\nthat. I mean, we do believe that in our tax returns, we don't foresee a significant tax liability for\\nthe next couple of years. But these are things which are constantly litigating it between us and\\nthe department, which is par for the course. But we don't foresee a significant amount of cash\\noutflow. At least for the next couple of years. Am i right?\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nYes, yes, absolutely.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nUnderstood. That it -- and lastly, the collection run rate has gone up to almost INR2,200INR2,300 crores. Is that a sustainable run rate? Or was there some completion additional\\ncollection that came through?\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nSo Puneet, if you remember, the guidance I had given on collections was a growth of almost\\n13% to 15%. And that maintain absolute numbers of close to INR6,400 - INR6,500 crores. So\\nyes, corrections have been good in first half, and I see a potential upside coming in collections\\nand the same upside I expect will flow in the OCF as well, which I clarified in the earlier part to\\nSaurabh.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nUnderstood. And then you lastly guided that construction cost would go up by roughly 50% over\\nthe previous year. That should be...\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nYes, INR1,200 crores of last year going close to INR1,700 crores. So that will be almost a 40%\\nincrease. A large part of it, you will see it in the second half.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nUnderstood, Thank you so much.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you, Our next question is from the line of Kunal Lakhan from CLSA. Please go ahead.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nSir, just on the Phase 5 side, you talked about pricing. We are getting closer to INR100,000 per\\nsquare feet. When I just look at your Slide 10, like when -- where we are talking about 5 million\\nsquare feet of luxury valued at about INR12,400 crores, I mean that's like 25,000 square feet. So\\ndoes this number see a significant upward revision? Because I believe the bulk of this would be\\nPhase 5.\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nSo what you are seeing is for a ready-to-move-in or ready apartments. And as far as valuation is\\nconcerned, definitely, you will see there is a tremendous upside there already. And as far as this\\nis concerned, if you go back to what it was earlier on certain price points at launch, they were - if I just go back 7 years, there was an ex-price. And today, that price is about 4x that value.\\nSo I wouldn't want to speculate on future values. But all I can say is there is a reasonably good\\nupside to what you have just mentioned. Right now, as what Mr. Tyagi was saying, that -- when\\nwe come closer to launch, that's when we made our pricing, and we true up the whole thing. But\\nat this point in time, this is just a guidance given. But as I said, you will obviously put together\\nalso. But there is a good reasonably positive outlook there.\\n\\nPage 9 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nBut again, we are not in the numbers game there in terms of this is going to be a staggered kind\\nof a launch as super luxury deserves. And there will be price points at various intervals that will\\ngo up based on how much stock we bring in at that point in time. And that's how we -- that's\\nhow we'll be approaching the DLF 5 story.\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nAnd just to add to what Aakash said, Kunal. See, when we had given this guidance, we had given\\nthis guidance towards the end of last fiscal year. And a lot has changed in the last 6 months, and\\ntherefore, keeping it short, yes, these numbers will undergo a change, and there is a potential\\nupside to this number.\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nYes. So again, Kunal, what Vivek and Aakash said, absolutely. These numbers will undergo\\nchange as the product and the pricing gets screwed up close to the launch. I mean we had the\\nobjective we had an internal debate of whether we should change these numbers now or as it\\nwas launched. Honestly, I mean, you know us as a company. We are conservative people.\\nWe don't -- I mean, we are not in the business of trying to milk every guidance upside from a\\nmarket standpoint. And so we are okay with this. But obviously, these numbers will undergo a\\npositive change as we hit closer to launch.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nGot it. Got it. And secondly, can you just comment a little bit on the new launches status in terms\\nof like where we are in terms of approvals and time lines, for example, for Sector 76 and also\\nfor Phase 5?\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nSo in 77, that's Privana, the approval process is on, and this is a Q3 end launch and so far so\\ngood. And the other one you mentioned was the DLF 5 one, right? So that is also on track for\\nQ4, but that was, as we had said, Q4, Q1. So that is also on track. So far, based on what we are\\ndoing internally, our approval processes are on track. And also for the Valley Orchard in\\nPanchkula, the SCO in Gurgaon. So all the approval process and the -- right now, we are meeting\\nthose time lines as we speak.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nSo Panchkula will be in Q3 just confirming, right? Panchkula in Q3?\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nYes, that's right.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nAnd DLF 5 will be in Q4?\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nYes. Q4, Q1, yes.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nOkay. Q1, there's a possibility it slipping in Q1?\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nNot slipping. It's part of the thing because this is -- as you know, it's a big, very big project, and\\nit's coming after Camellias was 2014. This is 20s almost a decade. So these products require that\\nkind of an intention. So 1 month here or there won't really matter, but I'm just saying you should\\nknow where we are as far as the planning is concerned. But so far, it's on track. It's just that we\\njust -- we'll take the call closer to Q4 or maybe in the beginning of Q4, we'll know exactly, say\\n-- by January, we'll know without to take.\\n\\nPage 10 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nAnd either way, Kunal, our sales guidance of 13,000 plus is under no threat, frankly, even if one\\nof these projects tend to slip by a few weeks here and there.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nSure. Understood. And my last question is on, again, like I think on the utilization of free cash\\nflows, like we are clocking almost like INR1,100- INR1,200 crores a quarter now. And with\\ndebt behind us now, how should we look at it incrementally going ahead because we'll end up\\npiling a lot of cash in coming quarters and years?\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nSo I think as, Kunal, I had said earlier, the -- it's very clear. I think the first priority is to really\\ngenerate as much as free cash as possible. And while we have INR3,100 plus crores of cash, the\\nfree cash available is INR450 crores. So the first priority is to make sure that we complete the\\nprojects, get the NOCs and convert that into free cash. So once we have free cash, yes, one of\\nthe things we could possibly do is to really repay some of the debt. Second is to really put the\\ncash behind growth, right? And third is to continue to reward the shareholders. I think that's\\nconsistently what we are following.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan\\n\\nSure, Thank you so much.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nOur next question is a text question from the line of Parikshit Kandpal from HDFC Securities.\\nCan you update us on the status of the Tulsiwadi and Andheri project?\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nOkay. So the Andheri project is on track, as we had mentioned last time. We -- in the slum rehab\\nis making very good progress. I think of the first phase of 30-odd stores somebody have 27-28\\nstores are already ready. And we stay on track for a potential launch around, I'd say, definitely\\nbefore June of '24. So that does look to be on track. And the first phase should be about 1 million\\nsquare feet of launch, give or take. Tulsiwadi has been in a significant legal mess and it's just\\ngone further deeper in that.\\nWe had made a bid for acquiring 100% of the shareholding of the company to the then lender,\\nPNBHFL, who did not -- who was unable to give us a position of 100% of the shares. Then they\\ndid a -- they sort of sold off the loan to an ARC, which sold off the stake to an entity. We went\\nto -- we and Shapoorji Pallonji both went to court against the completely non transparent method\\nthat the process was done.\\nThe Delhi High Court has made some scathing observations and has put all the shares in\\nsuspended animation. And I think both us and SPC are exploring the complete legal options on\\nboth counts; a, to restore the shareholding of the company back to where it should have been;\\nand b, to ensure that our outstanding debt from that company to us is not jeopardized.\\nSo I think we are an extremely strong solid -- I mean, legal ground. Delhi High Court has, by\\nand large, in their interim conclusion supported our stand. And now I think we just a question of\\nsort of taking that legal issue through all its right, I mean, course.\\nI think we just landed up in some sense in an unfortunate situation of what could have been a\\ngreat project. But we do hope that we'll eventually be able to come out without a financial loss,\\nmaybe with the shareholding also restored. And we are in the midst of that legal battle. Andheri\\nproject is on track.\\n\\nPage 11 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Pritesh Sheth from Motilal Oswal. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nFirst is to Mr. Khattar. So I think very good leasing quarter across the operations and the under\\nconstruction portfolio. Just wanted to get a sense of that leasing, 3 lakh square feet each leased\\nout in both SEZ, non-SEZ space. Where is the demand exactly coming from? Is it the existing\\ntenants expanding? Or are we also seeing some new tenants, specifically in SEZ spaces as well?\\n\\nSriram Khattar:\\n\\nSo I will start with the non-SEZ spaces. The demand is coming from new tenants and existing\\ntenants. And as I have mentioned earlier in the earlier analyst calls also the majority of the\\ndemand continues to be from the so-called global capability centers, which find India a very\\ncompelling location to look at because of its strong digital backbone, high-quality, global\\nquality, infrastructure and office spaces at a fraction of a cost, and very high-quality, young\\nEnglish-speaking skilled manpower.\\nThese -- they are expanding in the country, and I personally believe that in the next 4, 5 years,\\nthey will be a major contributor to the growth of the offices market. And then in Downtown\\nGurgaon, we have been able to establish a rental of INR150. And in downtown Chennai, we've\\nbeen able to establish a rental of INR100.\\nIn the SEZ space, fortunately, we are slightly better off than what the competition is. We have a\\nvacancy of about 14%-15 odd percent. We believe and we are given to understand that the\\nministry of commerce is in the final stages of allowing floor-wide de-notification. And once that\\ncomes, we will -- we believe that the demand for our quality spaces even in SEZs will go up.\\nAnd over the next 4-5 quarters, we'll see a fair amount of traction there also.\\nSo to add to this, what Saurabh asked in the beginning as to where the stock is, we believe that\\nfloor-wise de-notification will also give us about 800,000 to 1 million of stock in the next year\\nor so.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nSure. And just -- just a follow up on that, SEZ space is also seeing demand from new tenants or\\njust existing tenants expanding?\\n\\nSriram Khattar:\\n\\nIt's a combination of both. It is existing tenants expanding, say, about 60%, 70%, and 30%, 40%\\nnew tenants coming.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nGot it. Okay. And just 1 question on Camellias again, whether the inventory that is there right\\nnow in our slide, it's repriced to 1 lakh square feet, or -- what's the pricing assumption there?\\nBecause I'm seeing -- like if I add up the sales that we have done this quarter, plus the inventory\\nthat is their balance, there's a 20% jump in the inventory value. So what's the pricing assumption\\nnow in Camellias?\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nSo pricing is, as I mentioned earlier also, it's the lower, middle and higher floors. Higher floors\\ngo upwards of the number that you're talking about. The lower floors are basically based on that.\\nThere's a preference location thing, which is a 20% difference between the 3 segments that I just\\nmentioned. So that's where the valuations will be. Some of the inventory that is left, some of\\n\\nPage 12 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nthem are on a higher floor, some mid- and some growth. So based on that is what the valuation\\nis going to be. So if that's -- if I've been able to answer that for you.\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nYes. So the range would be -- Sorry, you can go ahead.\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nI think you -- so what we've done is that the current value of inventory is based on the average\\nprice realization of quarter 2, right? So -- and what Aakash is saying that the current price is\\ncertainly more than that. So answering your question, right, there will be a potential upside there\\nin pricing.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Abhinav Sinha from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAbhinav Sinha:\\n\\nA couple of questions. Firstly, on Privana. So is there a rethink on the product that we have there\\nversus the mid-rise that we were envisaging?\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nNo. So product, not we think in that way, but there was -- already, there were a couple of towers\\nof high-rise in Privana. So it was -- that's just been some more towers basically have been added\\nas high rise to the mid-rise scheme. That's all. So this -- in the plan, there was already highrise\\nis a mix of that with some mid-rise.\\nBut right now, there is -- I think it's just -- we've added more highlights to the scheme. So as we\\nkind of -- we feel that the demand there is more. And then, of course, the way it's coming out,\\nagain, it's -- if I can call it an Arbour 2 because it's just -- it's the same kind of spec and payouts\\nand all that.\\nAnd the approach infra closest to the biggest green land in Haryana. So for a home, it's -- it can't\\nbe more perfect. So that's what it is right now. And it's just gotten -- I mean, to answer that, it's\\njust -- now the product is enhanced even more, and therefore, that's what it is.\\n\\nAbhinav Sinha:\\n\\nRight. So we look for similar sell-throughs and does it also lead to better, let's say, FSI utilization\\nthere? Or that's not the idea here?\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nSo, Abhinav, I mean what we are launching there right now is barely covering a 1/4 of the total\\nsize that we have there. So we have an enormous degree of flexibility in terms of the -- of how\\nto use the maximum FSI available on that site. So I think what the product changes that Aakash\\nalluding to have been more driven by; a, the success of Arbour; and b, by what I think the\\ncustomers today looking forward is just -- it's not a stand-alone site where if you don't build now,\\nyou lose the FSI for life because this is a part of a far bigger land parcel. But yes, I mean, to\\nAakash's point, Currently, what we are looking at is a product, frankly, far closer to Arbour than\\nthe old colony sector...\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nSo adding to Mr. Tyagi's point, because just for you to put it in perspective, you can -- I mean,\\nonly a colloquial way of saying it, it can be called DLF 6, but there's so much to do there. There\\nis so much to do there because it's a good parcel, and we'll kind of build it from scratch.\\n\\nPage 13 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nAbhinav Sinha:\\n\\nOkay. secondly, and congratulations to Mr. Khattar on the strong performance we have seen. So\\nTyagi sir, my question is, does this bring us closer to the REIT offering now considering we are\\nhere. And the SEZ, you are also very positive on the Ministry of Commerce giving a favourable...\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nFirst, what will bring us closer to a REIT is the performance of the other REITs and not\\nperformance on Khattar. And those done doing significantly better. But to be fair, as I think we\\nhave said umpteen times in the past, we are now ready from a structuring standpoint to almost\\npress the button within a 180-day period of whenever the 2 shareholders decide.\\nI think it was, in some sense, in a pause mode for a variety of reasons, including COVID and the\\naftermath of COVID, the vacancy overhang that it left the bits and pieces and the entire interest\\nrate scenario. I think there's still possibly a few quarters away from the interest rate scenario\\nturning benign, which actually is the right time for a product like that.\\nBut clearly, I mean, our monetization at some stage, I'm sure will happen. It's just a question that\\n-- I mean that both the shareholders, while they are aware and cognizant of that, I don't think\\nthere right now, if I may use the word in a tearing hurry to do that. But at some stage, I'm sure\\nthat there will be an interesting amortizing option that will be executed.\\n\\nAbhinav Sinha:\\n\\nThank you and all the best to the team.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Saurabh Kumar from JP Morgan. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nSo just had a few more. So 1 is your staff cost is down quarter-on-quarter. What explains that?\\nI mean given the performance of the company. So that's first.\\nThe second is with Dwarka Expressway, we are now finally completing, sir. Is there are like a\\nlot of investor inventory, whatever gets unlocked and that kind of comes to the market? And\\nhow does it interact with your New Gurgaon supply, if you have any thoughts about what archive\\nDwarka Express completion in Gurgaon? So that's the second one.\\nAnd thirdly, Tyagi sir, you have kind of your sales guidance has gone from INR12,000 to\\nINR13,000 and this call INR13,000 crore plus. Would you want to kind of give a range as to\\nwhere you see the number or should it be better because every quarter now you...\\n\\nAshok Kumar Tyagi:\\n\\nI will answer your last question first before I defer to Vivek and Aakash on the balance piece so\\nmake in our card for the balance piece. We have always maintained a guidance of INR12,000\\ncrores - INR13,000 crores, and even in our last call, I had mentioned specifically that there is an\\nupside risk to this number, which is which is what -- I mean I believe that now maybe the upside\\nrisk is slightly stronger. So hence, I added the plus INR13,000 crores. But you won't not just into\\ngiving a sharper number than that.\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nStaff cost,Saurabh. Our staff cost for the full year is expected to be somewhere close to INR560\\ncrores to INR570 crores. So I think you are referring to quarter 1 and quarter 2 staff costs, where\\nquarter 2 staff cost has dipped, right? Is that... I think that's more to do with phasing of spend. I\\n\\nPage 14 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nthink quarter 1 has a larger provision for sales incentive, right, which is the sales incentive\\nnormally be booked with a lag of 1 quarter.\\nSo quarter 1 had impact coming from quarter 4 sales, which was the highest quarter in the last\\nfinancial year. And quarter 2 has sales incentive booked for INR2,000 crores of sales, which\\nhappened in quarter 1. I think that's the only reason why there is a difference. But on a full year\\nbasis, you can take INR560 crores, INR570 crores kind of a number.\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nAnd should your gross margins be higher because Camellias was booked into revenues like\\nwhen a the gross margins being higher than the 57% we are reporting?\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nNo. So you're talking about second half? I didn't get your question.\\n\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nNo, no. So this quarter, we would have booked these Camellias sales, right, into revenues, it's\\n14-odd apartments that's at a higher price. So the gross margins on those sales will be like north\\nof 70%, I'm guessing. So, your gross margin, which you are reporting is 55, sorry, 57?\\n\\nVivek Anand:\\n\\nSo Saurabh, what we -- what I've sold today is at a higher price and therefore, at a higher margin.\\nSo that margin will get recognized when we'll issue the possession letters, which will happen\\nsometime away. Now this 57% margin is for the positions I have given during the quarter and\\nsomething which was sold a year or 2 years back.\\n\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nGot it. and lastly on Dwarka Express way.\\n\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nWith reference to Dwarka Express way as you know, Saurabh, for over 5 years or whatever\\ninventory that was there, that has been still hanging around there. And that is more of an investor\\nmarket than anything else. So it kind of sometimes worries me next visit also. Because it's more\\nof -- I don't know who's finishing off what payments there, but everybody is near to make that\\ninitial transaction.\\nAnd post that, what's happening is, whether it's habitation or where it's anything else, that I feel\\nright now is contributing to what the other developments are seeing and especially in terms of\\nmoments and all. So I don't -- I mean, at this point in time, too early to comment. But whether\\nit's conflicting or not each markets are different. We are completely, as you know, sold out in\\nROG. I will only know post that. But each one of our projects kind of work on a different\\nparameter and requirement. And basically, as far as DLF is concerned, it is an end user's product.\\nSo speculators and that particular thing I feel at this point in time, I don't think we've gone after\\nthat for a long time. At least in my tenure, I can say that very clearly to you. So I think there are\\ntwo very different markets here, Saurabh.\\n\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nOkay. And just on your Phase 5, Aakash, so your Camellias has gone to nearly 1 lakh and now\\nyou're launching this mini Camellias, if I can call it, in Q4 or Q1. So now is it like Phase 5 breaks\\nthe pack from Gurgaon and now trades in line with Central Delhi, South Delhi types? Or is that\\nsomething you think is structurally now that the rate convergence between Phase 5 and South\\nDelhi has finally happened or...\\n\\nPage 15 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"DLF Limited\\nOctober 31, 2023\\nAakash Ohri:\\n\\nYes, yes. DLF 5 now you should be worried to compare it with Bombay what you're saying\\ncentral Delhi. So different about time, the kind of work that we've done and it's got accolades.\\nAnd I say it with pride as in Indian, I mean first DLF and then, of course, kind of product that is\\nbeing done and the ecosystem that is being kind of created. It is, today, when people -- when\\nforeigners come or people from outside NRIs and all, the first thing is like the Beverly of India,\\nBeverly Hills of India.\\nSo yes, the DLF 5 would see that because also had of a lot of infrastructure, as you've seen, the\\nsocial fabric is very strong. The kind of community that lives in the DLF 5 I can simply say half\\nof India's GDP is kind of contributor from the kind of people who are who are part of the\\ncommunity there. And the good part is people love staying there. So as far as that is concerned,\\nSaurabh, I see a lot of -- going forward also, it's become the choice.\\nI mean, today, if I can share this data also quickly with you. Any expat who's coming into the\\ncountry, and you know when they come in their 6 months before that, their first choice when\\nthey come for these reiki visits is to see where they're going to live. And whilst Delhi is an\\noption, Vasant Vihar and other colonies, DLF 5, DLF Golf Link is the most preferred choice.\\nAnd this I think will pick up from any data, any relocated companies and all.\\nSo today, I see that going up. And with the entire cost that is being great and especially the social\\ninfrastructure, I think it is now becoming the go-to place for by choice to live there. So once -first, it was something that we were pushing. Now it is more of a full product.\\nSo I think again, with the demand and supply syndrome, what's going to happen is that you will\\nsee this definitely going up, as you see, Mangolia today is trading at about almost INR60,000 -INR55,000 to INR60,000 a square foot, that's about INR35 crores to INR38 crores and where it\\nwas earlier.\\nSo these were all very latent demand. Nothing -- I don't see this as a volatile the kind of thing.\\nI'm seeing this as people who are -- have very few options of communities like this, it's like an\\ninto a central part where you have 500 acres of a green lung right in front of you, and then, of\\ncourse, the security system and everything else.\\nSo I think that's where the demand will be. And second, you've been holding it for 5 years on\\nlaunch pipelines and all. What Mr. Tyagi must told you must be music to all of your years,\\nhopefully, that now DLF pipelines are ready and things are happening. So I think that's\\nsomething that we are concentrating on.\\nAnd Vivek said, margins are something which is extremely dear to us. Our projects will be\\nlaunched only subject to what conditions are. And margins will prevail over any gross numbers\\nthat we have want to post. So that's where we are Saurabh. We are getting here.\\n\\nSaurabh Kumar:\\n\\nThank you, Happy Diwali.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question of our question-and-answer session.\\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Ashok Tyagi for closing comments.\\n\\nPage 16 of 17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

But honestly, I\\nthink this hitting at zero debt was a very important sort of. It's almost an emotional target for\\nmany of us over the last 8- 9 years, as you know, and we've taken a lot of steps in the last few\\nyears on this. So it's great that we finally hit there. I think this -- I mean, the future does foretell\\n-- I mean feel of strong cash flows and strong launches, hopefully.\\nThe RentCo, I mean, is doing an exceptional, exceptional job in terms of its leasing pipeline, it's\\nbuilt out of new capex, it's certification in all of these ESG and LEED certifications.

We will take our first question from\\nthe line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nGreat to see a mix of very broad-based growth across all the segments, so congrats on that broadbased growth. I just have a couple of questions. In the industry at this point of time, we are seeing\\ntwo phenomena. One is the new deals are taking time to get closed or start execution. The second\\nis the existing deals, the discretionary part of those deals is being put on hold or being delayed.\\nWhat in your case has led to that small discrepancy in the revenue, which led us to downgrade\\nour guidance? And what do you see -- how do you see those things playing out over the next 2\\nto 3 quarters.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo Vibhor, thank you so much. Vibhor, so let me say a couple of things. One, if I look at the last\\nquarter, when I had come to this call and before that as well, I've been talking about the fact that\\nthe number of deals that we have got in our pipeline – $10M+, $20M+, right -- and $50M+, even\\nthree-digit deals – is higher than where it was last year. And the deal velocity is slightly slower.\\nThe average deal size is slightly longer. I talked about this last time.\\nSo, the results have been that we've been able to sign the 7 deals that were $10M+ in Q2, right,\\nout of which 6 of them are $15M+. Actually, a couple of them are more than $20M+, a couple\\nof them are exactly $20M, etc. So there has been that colour. In addition to that, in the current\\nquarter also, that is Q3, which is progressing right now, we have signed $20M+& $10M+ deals,\\nthree deals that have been signed in the last two weeks as well.\\n\\nPage 8 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nSo from that standpoint, the funnel is bigger, and we are seeing those closures. Now the reason\\nthat we've been prudent and cautious slightly in terms of the guidance to saying 17.5% – 18.5%,\\nthough our internal targets are to reach the original numbers that we had told you, is that the\\nmarket in the last 3 weeks/5 weeks has changed slightly. One, you are aware of the UAW strikes\\nfrom mid-September that has been happening in the US, which has put a pause on a couple of\\nprojects that we were working on. We don't know when that's going to lift off.\\nSecond, with this developing situation that's happening in the world, we are not totally sure as\\nto which way will this come and sit. Though we don't have too much operations in Israel. It's\\nvery small, and we continue to pray for our small team that's there. But what will be the indirect\\nimpact, we're not sure.\\nAnd therefore, I shared with you also that we have an algorithm that we use for computing this.\\nSo -- and we have taken that into account, and that's why you're seeing the revised one. We will\\ncome back again in January & if things turn, we will let you know. But we continue to work, we\\ncontinue to be optimistic. We continue to be hiring. We continue to invest in technology.\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nSure. Great to hear those words of optimism from somebody at least in the industry. Thanks for\\nthat Amit.\\nThe second question I had was on the Telecom segment. Now in this quarter, we have won this\\ndeal as you mentioned, with the SWC capabilities being added. Now traditionally, in the\\nTelecom and Hitech segment, we've been more towards Telecom and Hitech than the Telecom\\nservice providers, the TSPs. Will that mix change? Or has that mix already changed in favour of\\nTelecom service providers because of SWC integrating into the business? And do you think that\\ncould increase the growth that this segment could see given the Telcos globally are bleeding.\\nThere have been very few monetizable cases of 5G & Telcos across the world has not been able\\nto ramp up there, let's say, ARPUs or their revenue profile because of 5G adoption?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo see, it's more than just 5G or Telco providers, it is two or three things that we should look at.\\nWe also look at cybersecurity for this segment as a horizontal offering across enterprise as well\\nas Telecom, right? One, what's happened is with the 5G – with the SWC acquisition, our skill\\nlevel, our skill depth, our expertise has definitely gone through a shift and a change towards the\\npositive way. That is helping us in having more mature conversations with Telecom Infra OEMs\\nas well as Operators and actually, at times, it's really spilling over also with some of the Media\\nwork that we are doing that borders on this. So, it's helping us have those conversations.\\nThe deal we have closed, which is a first Smart World deal, a $10M+ deal. We had closed a\\nsmaller one earlier. This is the first $10M+ deal for this business, we have closed with a US\\ncustomer. In Q3, i.e., in the last two weeks, we have closed the cyber deal of $10M+, again, with\\nan international customer, these are at LTTS standard margins, right? So, it is helping us change\\nthe conversation.\\nThe Second thing that we are seeing, and we talked about the deals we have won in India with\\nSmart World, is we are proud to say the work that we have won in Smart World in India actually\\n\\nPage 9 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nhas a component of software that we have developed in-house that we're going to be deploying\\nas well, right? So that is a value-add service that we are providing.\\nThird, with the work that we are doing with Telecom, we are able to go to Semcon companies,\\nwe're able to go to Telecom Infra companies and work with them to be able to bring them to\\nIndia together. So, it's becoming like a ‘sell with,’ ‘solution with’ conversations that was not\\nhappening prior to Smart World.\\nLastly, we are getting to finally own an entire end-to-end project work that again was not there\\nearlier. Again, story to be played out. Early days, we've made the investments. We have stood\\nup our team in the Middle East, our full sales team in the Middle East. We've seen some smart\\ncity opportunities there as well. The pipeline is there. So, to be played out Vibhor, but definitely\\nfor the better. And per our plan, as we had thought about when we purchased this business.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Akshay Ramnani from Axis Capital. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nAkshay Ramnani:\\n\\nCongrats on good execution on margins. So, my first question was on SWC seasonality. So,\\nduring last quarter's earnings call, you mentioned that SWC has a seasonally stronger H2. Now\\nwhen I try to look at the numbers where you have given revenues for including SWC and\\nexcluding SWC for FY23 and take the difference out there, it appears that in Q2 of FY23, SWC\\nis having strong sequential growth & it also appears that H1 was stronger than H2 in FY23. So,\\ncan you please clarify on the SWC seasonality? And also maybe comment on how did SWC is\\nperforming Q2 of the current quarter, if you may add did you also see that seasonal uptick in this\\nquarter?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSure. So, thank you so much, Akshay. In fact, if I take away the SWC revenue from the quarter,\\nsame quarter last year, the growth is approximately 16% for us as a company, right? But having\\nsaid that, if I look at the SWC business now, see, the whole goal of integrating SWC, buying\\nSWC and integrating it together as one team, one company, one division was that we would like\\nto take this business internationally, investing in a full-scale sales team in Middle East, investing\\nin a full-scale sales team in the US as well as parts of Europe. The whole idea was – 1) take the\\nbusiness international, 2) take away the seasonality to the extent possible and cyclicality to the\\nextent possible 3) to improve margins in India and become value-added rather than just being a\\nreseller/provider. I think all those dots we are trying to do. Again, these are early days. It's only\\nthe second quarter that we have run together. So, to be seen as we go forward, there are some\\ngood deals that are in the pipeline for the business as well.\\nAnd now we don't call it Smart World anymore, we call it NGC, Nex Gen Comms. So, we do\\nhave a pipeline for the Nex Gen Comms business, and we are actively working and pursuing to\\ntry and close some of these deals internationally as well as in India. So, to be seen and to be\\nplayed out as we move along. And we'll keep you updated as things develop and go forward.\\n\\nPage 10 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nI do want to just say one more thing. We have packaged two of the solutions that our NGC\\nbusiness has created. We have packaged it. We won our first order for the license as well, and\\nwe are doing more in that area. So, to be played out, to be seen.\\nAkshay Ramnani:\\n\\nMy question on SWC seasonality part, I think remained unanswered…\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nI’ll address it, yes. So, look, I'm not going to look in rear view mirror and say what happened\\nlast year. We are playing it in the current year as we are, and we'll see how Q3 and Q4 do, to be\\nplayed out.\\n\\nAkshay Ramnani:\\n\\nOkay. And my second question is on headcount additions. So, the sub-500 QoQ addition while\\nit is positive, but I guess still lower than maybe your estimate of 750 net adds at least in Q2. This\\nis despite a reduction in attrition. So, is it fair to say that this was because of demand deterioration\\nthrough the quarter? And also is our utilization now closer to peak levels because looks like that\\nwas one of the levers to margin this quarter?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, thank you, Akshay. Very valid question. Actually, the way you have to think about it is that\\nif we get a signal that future, so we normally know what kind attrition numbers we will have a\\nquarter in advance, right? Because there is a notice period and we've got an algorithm with HR\\nthat does that very carefully. So, we do see attrition levels stabilizing. That allows us to be able\\nto leverage the bench better, have a smaller bench, if I may, and tune hiring to make sure that\\nwe are not losing so many people, be able to actually free up some people that are there and have\\nthem work, improve utilization. improve pyramid, etc.\\nSo, with all that, I would not read too much between the 500+ to the 700+. We've had some\\njoining that have been there in the first week of October as opposed to September. That's all\\nthere is to it. We will continue, like Rajeev mentioned, we are a path of profitable, sustainable\\ninclusive growth, right? And you will see us being careful as we continue to be always, in terms\\nof how many we need, what can be re-purpose internally, etc. In fact, our training institute has\\nbeen working overtime and reskilling people as well & that's how you will see this going\\nforward.\\nFor the record, about 2,000 freshers we had hired last year. So far, we've onboarded & we're\\ngetting a similar number this year. We've already onboarded more than 1,000 so far, and the\\nremaining offers that are there will be honoured in the next two quarters, there's a plan for it as\\nwe move forward. We are, in fact, starting to discuss college campus hiring for next year as well\\nand finalizing those numbers as we speak.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Sulabh Govila from Morgan Stanley. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nSulabh Govila:\\n\\nSo, first is with respect to the guidance that we've revised, I just wanted to understand what's the\\nsplit of this guidance ex of SWC? I mean, on an organic basis, what's the number that you're\\nlooking at for FY24?\\n\\nPage 11 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo Sulabh, thank you so much for asking. Actually, we had mentioned this in the last call that\\nwe look at this now as an integrated business. And we don't look at it as two businesses anymore\\nbecause now the international deals are being one, that means some of the Smart World resources\\nare being used, NGC resources are being leveraged for that. There is work that is happening in\\nIndia where we are leveraging some of the LTTS heritage resources as well; So, it's now become\\none team. So, we are guiding at this stage, 17.5% to 18.5% and comfortable with the upper part\\nof the spectrum.\\n\\nSulabh Govila:\\n\\nUnderstood. Then with respect to margins, Rajeev, the sharp decline in SG&A expenses that\\nwe've seen this quarter, and this is especially with the number of sales employees increasing. So\\njust trying to understand what has led to this sharp decline? And how much of this is sustainable\\ngoing through the quarters?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nYes. Thank you, Sulabh. So let me clarify, the increase in headcount that you see is largely on\\nthe enabling side. As we grow, we also need to ensure that our enabling functions are able to\\ncope up with the increase in demand and of course, the scale of business that we operate in. See,\\nsome of the reduction that you see in the SG&A side, is actually planned for, right?\\nOne of that comes from the synergies from SWC acquisition. We talked about it. We ran the\\nprocess on integration. We have now concluded. We merged the two businesses. A lot of the\\nnon-billable resources that used to be part of G&A, now are moving into billable roles. Second,\\nfacilities have been consolidated. That has been another area that has given us benefit. So, the\\nsynergies are truly translated.\\nSecond, given that we see that there are challenging conditions that's always prudent to think\\noptimization. We indeed optimize our G&A costs. So, areas like travel, welfare spend, all of\\nthese areas we have carefully looked at and optimized upon.\\nThird is we've had lower stock option cost in this quarter relative to previous quarters.\\nThen also looking at our variable pay provision. We've looked at it in relation to the sales targets\\nand accordingly adjusted for it. So, these are a few reasons where you see.\\nNow in terms of sustaining the levels, we believe that we have been in the range of 10%. We\\nbelieve we will continue to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%. While I mentioned this, there are, of\\ncourse, a lot of opportunities that we see on the gross margin side. I'll probably add on to it\\nbecause for us looking at all of the cost in one stack is important. So, while we've seen the gross\\nmargin come down this quarter, it is truly because we value our employees as an important\\nstakeholder. We did go through with our increments and we feel there's a good opportunity on\\nimproving the utilization on freshers.\\nWe also believe that there are going to be further opportunities in terms of optimizing on\\nsubcontracting or TPC cost, offshoring, we mentioned about it and travel, right? So, these are\\nall areas that we're going to continue to play upon. And between gross margin & SGA continue\\nto see that we maintain our aspiration of 17% EBIT for FY24.\\n\\nPage 12 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nSulabh Govila:\\n\\nSure, Rajeev. So just a quick follow-up. So does that mean that there is some sort of conservatism\\nbaked in the full year guidance and 18% expectation in 1H FY26 because the way we absorb the\\nwage hikes in this quarter, ideally one would imagine this happens throughout the year. So, there\\nshould be more tailwinds to margins and 2H versus what we are implying right now?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSo Sulabh, in a way, I would say, yes. A lot has to be seen in terms of how we see revenue\\ntranslate. Amit did talk about some of the headwinds. In the current environment in the last\\nmonth or so has not been that great. We believe it all played out well, we should be able to come\\nslightly better off. But of course, we have to see that through. Of course, Q3 also is one of the\\nmost challenging quarters, right?\\nNow all of the costs we have planned, keeping in mind that these challenges are being addressed\\nfor. So like I said, we maintain our 17% EBIT levels in terms of aspiration for FY24 and continue\\nto look at the stack of cost as to how do we optimize or allow the scalability in terms of investing\\nin technology.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Karan Uppal from Phillip Capital. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nKaran Uppal:\\n\\nYes. Thanks for the opportunity. So, Amit, one question on the longer decision cycles you have\\nmentioned in the press release. So is the slowdown in between cycles across verticals for you or\\nsome verticals are more stressed than others at this point of time. And how confident are you to\\nachieve the guidance because it still requires 2% to 3% CQGR you're in H2?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nKaran, thank you. I'll answer your second question first and the first question second.\\nSo, I would like to confirm to you that internal targets are higher than the guidance, and we will\\ncontinue to strive to see that we meet those and do well, right? So unequivocally, I want you to\\nthink about this. And we have baked in some amount of happenings in the last few weeks, like\\nI said in one of the earlier answers.\\nNow number two, do we see a slowdown happening across. See more than a slowdown, I would\\ncall it caution. There is caution in terms of conversations, there are clients that are having with\\nus. They are wanting to wait and watch how things turn out, right? Because there's a lot of these\\nreports coming out every day that are fairly counter to each other. And every client is looking at\\ntheir own market, they're looking at their own cost stack, etc. So, we are seeing decision-making\\ncautious. We are seeing people asking us more data before they make a decision.\\nWhat we are doing to address that is to pile up more proposals. So, we are trying to see how we\\nramp up our pipeline to a much larger extent. In fact, my colleague, Alind Saxena, is driving that\\ninitiative of seeing, what can we do in terms of improving the pipeline.\\nAlind, would you like to share a few words on what we're doing around the pipeline?\\n\\nAlind Saxena:\\n\\nThank you. So, across the sectors if we look at the five different sectors that we play in, we today\\nhave sufficient pipeline and we have made some provisions for backups in case some of the\\nPage 13 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\ndecisions get delayed. And we are seeing a fair amount of reception back from the customers on\\nthat. We are fairly confident that, we are going to be able to close them in time to make sure that\\nwe meet our guidance as we go through. And as we look forward, we see the momentum\\ncontinuing and being stable over the next few months and few weeks that we have in front of us.\\nThank you.\\nKaran Uppal:\\n\\nOkay. Second question, Amit, is slightly on the longer side, specifically on SDV-related area.\\nSo do you want to highlight any investments you are making maybe on the capability side or on\\nthe labs? Any large deals in the pipeline within this area, because peers have started announcing\\npretty large deal in software defined vehicles. So any update from that side will be very helpful.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, on the SDV side, see, as we look at the SDV stack, we look at it as a hardware layer, we look\\nat it as a compute layer, embedded layer and then the software layer and then the data layer. So\\nthere are four parts to SDV that we are discussing here.\\nSo, one, we are in active dialogue, conversations have engaged in a partnership model with\\nsilicon majors, where we are getting our people – One, trained on the latest chips and how will\\nthey be leveraged on high-performance computing chips. Second, we are -- we have won smaller\\ncontracts, and then we are looking at bigger contracts to do semiconductor design for these highperformance chips for SDV.\\nSecond, with OEMs and Tier 1s, we are working closely to ramp up work for them. There are\\ndouble-digit deals that we are currently in play in our pipeline in the SDV area that we are trying\\nto actively pursue and close and ramp up.\\nThird, we've actually leveraged our Global Engineering Academy to try and develop the skills\\ninternally and retrain people.\\nFourth, there are tools that we have developed around leveraging Gen AI. There's a tool called\\nEvQUAL, it's on our website, that's hosted on AWS. There is a Digital Twin for digital cockpit\\nwe have built. There is Ethernet simulator we have built. There is hawkBit, another one that we\\nhave built. There are various components that we have built that are leveraging for the OEMs\\nand Tier 1s as we move forward. So, deals in play, deals in progress, a ramp-up happening across\\nUS, Europe and Japan.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nThank you. Amit, if I heard you right, the only area that you really called out softness, it was\\nsemiconductors. And Q3, historically, it hasn't been really bad for LTT, if you want to look at\\nit. Is anything different this time?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo one, we do expect there to be a softness in Medical, right? I'm calling that out. Number two,\\nSemcon and ISV, my belief is that the pain will be over by Q3 and in Q4, things should turn\\naround in Semicon and ISV. So there's another quarter of pain left in that particular area.\\n\\nPage 14 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nOutside of that, regular furloughs, Ravi, the only thing that we don\\'t know is that because of the\\nUAW strike since mid-September, some of our projects were put on hold. And we are not sure\\nwhether we\\'ll be able to leverage the working days in this quarter to work on it or will it slip to\\nnext quarter. So some of that is what\\'s going on.\\nHaving said that, we\\'re still cautiously approaching the quarter. That\\'s why I said in my\\ncommentary that Q3 there it\\'s still got to play out, right? In addition to that, there\\'s a couple of\\ndeals going on that we have got that could help us in the quarter, this and next one, if we are able\\nto sign them. So again, an active discussion ongoing if I may, Ravi.\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nAnd I know for you, Transportation is not just Auto, but really strong growth there. But in Auto\\nshould we worry about the EV transition because we have been reading reports at EV sales are\\nnot really going through as expected and automakers are actually seeing bigger inventories of\\nEV vehicles now?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo Ravi, there are two parts here. Number one, we are not just Auto. We are, like you said, we\\nare Auto, we have Commercial Vehicles, Trucks & Off Highway, Aerospace and Rail. So we\\nare across the segment. That\\'s number one. Number two is that our -- though we are rated highest\\nin EV, and I\\'m truly complementary of the entire team that came together to deliver it, we are\\nnot a single trick pony. There is other offerings that we have got in the area that we are\\nleveraging, right?\\nIn fact, the investments in SDV that we are doing, we believe is the future, like AI. So, AI,\\ncybersecurity, SDV as well as next-gen compute and next-gen comms is the future. So, we\\'ll\\ncontinue to invest. And not just that, I would go a step further and say that one thing that we\\'ve\\nbeen able to leverage very successfully, like for SDV we did.\\nWe took a 50-member team from our Semiconductor practice and a 50-member team from our\\nConsumer Electronics practice, and we put that as a seed team for SDV and said, \"Go build and\\nlet\\'s go ahead and grow\", right? We have done that for EV, if you remember three years ago by\\ntaking 100 people from Industrial Products and power electronics.\\nSo we will cross leverage skills from SDV and automotive to other areas if required to\\nsupplement. And that is exactly the reason why we are in five verticals, and I do believe that this\\nwill be a shock absorber for others in case there\\'s a slowdown in one area. But we remain actively\\nengaged across. Pipeline again, is higher than it was same time last year and continues to grow.\\nAnd a targeted effort being made towards SDV, Alind spoke about it, running a specific program\\nin the company to ramp up the pipeline.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Bhavik Mehta from JPMorgan. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nBhavik Mehta:\\n\\nThank you. Couple of questions. Amit, the decision-making delays, what you mentioned, is it\\njust on the deal closures or also in terms of project ramp-up because it seems like the deal\\nclosures have been strong for you. And then assuming that, it\\'s more on the conversion side\\n\\nPage 15 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nwhere there's is an issue, is that a fair understanding? And secondly, if I look at the geography,\\nit seems like a lot of the growth was driven by Europe and India, while US was soft. So any\\ncolour on the US geography in terms of what verticals are taking in headwinds over there? Thank\\nyou.\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSure. So Bhavik, thank you. So Bhavik, number one, when I say decision-making delays, I'm\\nreferring to a couple of things here.\\nNumber one is that the deal tenure that we were winning has increased; if we were winning deals\\nthat were 2.5 years long, now those deals that we are winning now are on an average about 3.2\\nyears long, right, is what's happened. So therefore, there is a longer ramp-up and then get to a\\nstable phase and then potentially closure.\\nSecond, what is happening is that in July, when we came in and talked to you & then we did\\nroadshows in August, right? At that point of time, and now what we've seen is, September,\\nOctober, though, we've been successful, right? I mean three deals – two $20M+ & one $10M+\\njust in the first two weeks of October that we have signed, that we have landed. But I still feel\\nthat there is a sort of a wait and watch kind of hesitation that's coming across that we are seeing.\\nPeople are talking about next year, right? So – ‘let's do this, let's do this. Well, let's start in\\nJanuary,’ right? There’re others they're saying, let's start and then let's start smaller and then we\\nwill ramp up with you. But we want to bolt down resources, we want to bolt down plans and\\ntake it forward. So there is some amount of wait and watch that we are seeing creep into\\nconversations.\\nHaving said that, there is still vendor consolidation. There is still new age areas that people are\\nramping up in and that is giving us an advantage. In fact, I would say most of the wins we are\\ngetting now is in newer age areas rather than the older sustenance engineering – older areas that\\nwere there. So that's number one.\\nNumber two, you are absolutely right. Europe has done very well for us. In fact, I remember\\nabout 2.5 years ago, one of the calls, there was a worry that in Europe, are you serious, will it\\ngrow? And we had said that we will grow Europe. I would complement the team that delivery\\nand the sales leadership team in Europe. We've done extremely well in the last couple of quarters.\\nAnd knock on wood, I do see that growth continuing. This is across DACH, Nordics,\\nNetherlands, and France. And we are clear we are not in other geos, these are the geos, and it's\\nnot just Transportation, it is Transportation and the Digital Manufacturing that we are seeing\\ngrowth in.\\nNot only that, but Japan has also grown for us. And I'm, again, complementing the team that has\\nworked hard Japan to grow not just automotive but Automotive, Hitech and Industrial Products.\\nSo we are seeing that. We are actually trying to see if we can get into Plant Engineering in Japan\\nnow to be seen how it plays out, right?\\nIndia, of course, the growth is part of the Nex Gen Comms business that we have had, etc.\\n\\nPage 16 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nU.S. Now where are we seeing a little bit of headwinds. We are seeing headwinds in the U.S. in\\nsemiconductor and ISV space. And that did have an impact on us in the current quarter. We\\ncould have done maybe $1M potentially more this quarter, had the UAW strike not happened,\\nthat cut us off about $700- 800K this quarter. So that -- there's a little bit of this there. But we\\nhave expanded our sales engine. We are all guns blazing. We've started ideation processes on a\\ncontinuous basis. So, to be seen how things are, but to be worked out, to be played out, and we'll\\ncontinue to keep you engaged and updated as things progress.\\nBhavik Mehta:\\n\\nJust a follow up on that. Any early signs on furlough from clients, what are you hearing from\\nclients in the combination regarding the December quarter furlough it is higher or lower or status\\nquo compared to historical value level?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo similar to last year, Bhavik, but to play out to play out. I still have a hunch, it may turn out to\\nbe slightly better, but we don't know yet. So, to be played out Bhavik. Truly to be played out.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Abhishek Shindadkr from InCred Capital.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Shindadkr:\\n\\nHi, sir. Thanks for the opportunity and congrats on good execution. And just a clarification on\\nthe data point that you mentioned that the revenues could be $800K to $1M higher before the\\nUAW strike. Should we also assume a similar number baked into your guidance in terms of why\\nthe reduction happened from – especially from this project?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo Abhishek, thank you. Abhishek, I was giving an example on quantifying a certain situation\\nwhen I gave that number, right? The point is that there are – I mean you are aware of the macros\\nthat are developing right now with the kind of uncertainty that's there. So, there is a general\\ncaution Abhishek that we are baking into the guidance that we are providing, Abhishek.\\n\\nAbhishek Shindadkr:\\n\\nGot it, sir. Thank you for taking my question and best wishes for the year.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have our next question from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nYes, thanks. Thanks for the opportunity and congrats on a good execution, especially on the\\nmargins. Amit, the first question is, if I look at the ask rate to achieve the next guidance at the\\nupper end, which you are confident is roughly around 3.4%. And in our previous calls, we have\\nsaid for SWC, the H2, which be heavier versus H1. So, is it fair to assume that the organic growth\\ncould be lower than 3.4% on a QoQ basis, that is what you are assuming in the guidance,\\nexcluding SWC?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSandeep, thank you. Sandeep, everything is organic now, that's the way we look at it. So, we are\\nbaking in some pluses and some minuses. While international, meaning the U.S., like the\\ncolleague prior to you saw very rightly, the U.S. was a little light, while Europe, India did better.\\nSo, this is to be played out. There are deals in the pipeline right now that we have to sell and\\ndeliver to achieve this guidance. I mean let me be very clear in that. And there are deals in the\\n\\nPage 17 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nU.S., there are deals in Europe, there are India deals, there are Middle East deals that we are\\nworking on. So, to be seen how it plays out, Sandeep.\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nYes. Yes. Just a clarification Amit, you also, in one of your statements, said the organic growth\\nin this quarter on a YoY is 16% or something else, there is some mistake in my hearing as a\\nwhole. And what is your view on the Consumer Electronics, which we were expecting some\\namount of slowdown in the 1Q outlook?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nLet me answer your first question, and I'll request you to repeat your second. So, Sandeep, what\\nI was saying was we have re-casted last year financials, and we've added Smart World in last\\nyear's financials, right? If I was to not add them in last year's financials and only add them into\\ncurrent year financials, like I would do to any company I would buy that was not joint ownership\\nor whatever they call it, the right word, then you would have seen 16% YoY. That is what I was\\nreferring to.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nOkay. Okay. Now it's clear. And the second question was on consumer electronics where you're\\nslightly expecting a pain in the 1Q earnings call. Any change in the outlook?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, when we say ISV, we include some of these Consumer Electronic companies in that space\\nas well. So ISV and Semcon, we've been signalling that -- there was -- we saw cuts in work\\nbeing given to us and that impacted us negatively in Q1and in Q2. We do expect it to impact us\\nin Q3 as well. And we expect stuff to turn around in Q4 because we believe that some of the\\nnew products coming out will require workforce to be added.\\nIn fact, some of the work that we've done in Gen AI, where we have developed tools and we've\\nactually taken – we've created manufacturing use cases that we have done in Gen AI around\\npredictive maintenance, that we have done in AI-powered optical inspection, around demand\\nforecasting, around software defined endoscopy for real-time video, all this work that we have\\ndone is going to help us actually capture some market share in ISV and Semcon. And we believe\\nthat will help us as we move forward.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have a next question from the line of Surendra Goyal from Citigroup. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nSurendra Goyal:\\n\\nYes, hi. Good evening. Amit, just trying to understand some of your comments better. So, you\\nsaid and I think, you also said earlier that last month or so or last few weeks that trends have\\nshown a little bit of a slowdown, but on the other side, you also said that furlough, you expect\\nthem to be better than last year. And last year, we were in a fairly robust demand environment.\\nSo, I was just trying to understand what is your thoughts process there.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo Surendra, what I'm saying is that, look, do we expect -- because this conversation was, I think\\nI had with some of you that said do we think it will be a Christmas quarter, right? And at this\\nstage, looking at what we've been seeing in the later part of September, we don't think it's going\\nto be a Christmas quarter, right? Having said that, it has to be played out because the cues that\\nwe are getting from different customers is different, right? So, to be played out, like I said, and\\n\\nPage 18 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q2 FY24 Earnings Call\\nOctober 17, 2023\\n\\nthat we have taken into account when we have given the revised guidance. I'm sorry if I sounded\\ncontradictory there but I want to be clear that we do not expect a Christmas quarter.\\nSurendra Goyal:\\n\\nSure. And just one clarification, Amit. Was your earlier guidance conservative as well or was\\nthat realistic?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, Surendra, whenever we provide guidance, we always look at various items. We look at things\\nhappening, we look at our ability to win, our differentiators & we bake that all in. And that's\\nhow we do this. Now we don't have a crystal ball and we will continue to improve ourselves and\\nwork on this is what I would say so. Surendra, the one principle we follow as a management\\nteam is that if we know something, we will make sure we don't surprise you, we let you know.\\nThat is the credibility we want to build with you and that's what we stand for.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you.

Trust all of you are doing\\nwell.\\nLet me provide you key highlights on our Q1 performance:\\n•\\n\\nWe had a quarter of growth despite the macro challenges and slowdown in decision\\nmaking in some pockets.\\n\\n•\\n\\nOverall, we grew by 10% YoY in constant currency. The comparison on YoY is more\\nlike-to-like given the fact that H2 is always higher than H1 for the Smart World &\\nCommunication (SWC) business.\\n\\n•\\n\\nOur revenue grew by 0.6% sequentially organically with Transportation leading the\\ngrowth at 4%, while Medical and Industrial Products had about 0.5% to 1% growth.\\n\\n•\\n\\nOverall, organic sequential growth was 7.5% YoY in constant currency.\\nPage 2 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\n•\\n\\nOperational performance was strong with EBIT margin at 17.2%, which is post the\\naddition of SWC. PAT was at ₹ 311 crores, up 13% YoY.\\n\\n•\\n\\nOur large deal engine continues to fire with a total of 6 deals above $10M, of which\\none is a $50M TCV deal that we signed this quarter. All deals have moved to\\nexecution.\\n\\n•\\n\\nOn other dimensions, happy to share that we filed 55 patents for our customers and\\nourselves taking the cumulative count to 1,145 patents. We were rated as a Great Place\\nto Work (GPTWTM) in India again and Poland for the first time. Attrition is down 330\\nbps to 18.9%. We expect this trend to continue.\\n\\nMoving on to segmental performance and outlook.\\nStarting with Transportation,\\n•\\n\\nStrong show of 4% QoQ growth that was broad-based across the sub-segments – Auto,\\nTrucks & Off Highway and Aero.\\n\\n•\\n\\nDemand continues to be strong, led by EV and Connected Cars in Auto, Electrification\\nin Trucks and Off Highway, and Avionics in Aerospace.\\n\\n•\\n\\nWe won a $10M+ deal with a Transportation customer who had earlier chosen us as\\ntheir preferred engineering partner.\\n\\n•\\n\\nWe continue to invest in Transportation capabilities for the future like softwaredefined vehicles (SDV). We are working on creating a digital architecture for a future\\nstate SDV that will require a centralized platform with high compute processing\\npower, cybersecurity, and high-speed connectivity. We again filed 8 patents in\\nTransportation in this quarter. My colleague, Abhishek, as required, will provide more\\ndetails on SDV.\\n\\n•\\n\\nIn the connected car area, we are seeing incremental opportunities to manage\\nSOC/NOC – by leveraging our SWC capabilities.\\n\\nOverall, we see a good pipeline of opportunities across all 3 sub-segments and expect the growth\\nmomentum to sustain.\\nIn Plant Engineering,\\n•\\n\\nThis differentiated segment remains on solid footing. Q1 was a one-off as we were\\nimpacted by decision making and supply delays by customers that slowed down the\\npace of ongoing projects.\\n\\n•\\n\\nWe see a bounce back in the next quarter as the pace of decision making, regulatory\\nand other factors have seen an improvement in June and July.\\n\\nPage 3 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

While this industry is still in inventory correction mode, we are moving up the\\ncapability spectrum and winning some deals in key areas – I would like to highlight a\\npost-silicon validation deal that we won in Q1, which will involve setting up a design\\nstudio offshore.\\n\\n•\\n\\nAs we partner with chip companies to develop new-age chips for cloud computing,\\ndata center as well as Automotive industry, our growth is set to pick up.\\n\\n•\\n\\nWe are also seeing good opportunities as global ER&D companies move\\nmanufacturing from China to India.

              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much. The first question is from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal Oswal\\nFinancial Services. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nAmit, just one question from my side. And I think – sorry about this being a recurring topic. But\\ngiven the delays and push outs which you saw in the first quarter, what is giving us the\\nconfidence of delivering a 10% organic growth in FY24? What really are you seeing in terms of\\nclient visibility that such issues might not recur anytime over the next 3 quarters? Because\\ncurrently, if I kind of do a rough number crunching, it looks like your compounded quarterly\\ngrowth rate would be upwards of 4% for the next 3 quarters. If you could just help us walk\\nthrough what really is behind this confidence of maintaining the revenue growth?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nThank you, Mukul. So, a couple of things here, and I'll answer it broadly. So, we look at growth,\\nright? Number one, some of the deals did get delayed in terms of decisions. We were expecting\\nthem to be signed end of April, early May, but they got signed towards the end of June, right?\\nSecond, if I look at Plant Engineering, it was not a deal problem. It was more a – getting inputs\\nfrom customer on time problem. So, that book of business still is with us and therefore can be\\naccelerated, executed. So, I don't have a problem there. I have an issue in Semcon, which I don't\\nknow if it will be a 1 quarter pain or is it a 1.5 quarter pain, right? So that's the only blip that I\\nsee.\\nBut given the facts that First, pipeline is stronger now than it was a quarter ago and YoY; Second,\\nthe 6 deals that we have won, those have gone into execution, and Third, there are other deals in\\nthe pipeline that we are expecting to close or very close to closing, I do have confidence of\\nretaining the guidance.\\nNow also, on SWC, it's H1 to H2 business, H2 being much better than H1. So overall, that\\n20% plus holds that we are at this stage.\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nRight. Sir, just a quick follow-up on that. Given that you have seen scaling up in these 6 deals\\nin the last few months, is the confidence also kind of baking in a fairly strong second quarter,\\nwhich gives you enough buffer for any potential trouble down the line in the second half?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nYes, Mukul. See, I'll tell you what we did. So, after I went back in April, we have spent time\\ntalking to the clients, working with them through their decision-making process.\\nOne, reality is where a deal would take 2 signatures, it now takes 4 signatures, right? That's the\\nreality. So how do we get that done quickly – is the whole thing that we continue to work on.\\nSecond, I'm betting on the fact that some of the deals that we are sitting on in Semcon or in\\nConsumer Electronics will close faster than what I saw in Q1. And thirdly, I do expect H2 to be\\nbetter than H1 as we stand today.\\nWe are working on all 3, in fact, I should confirm to you that net headcount will go up by at least\\n750 people in Q2 as compared to Q1, and we're already on our way to making those offers,\\npeople have been joining us. So fairly comfortable and confident.\\n\\nPage 11 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nBut we'll keep you updated, Mukul. I mean we've always been very transparent, very direct, and\\nwe thank you all for your confidence in us. So, we continue to work on this and come back to\\nyou. We, in fact, hosted a client advisory council first time ever in our history. So about 16\\nclients controlling a huge amount of revenue and market cap came together, spent some time\\nwith us. So, we've got some trends from them. We've got some information on – why don't you\\napprove what you don't approve also. So fairly good conversations, candid conversations, I'm\\nfairly comfortable.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Sulabh Govila from Morgan Stanley. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nSulabh Govila:\\n\\nMy first question is on SWC. So, on the numbers that is reported, which is 1Q FY23 and the 4Q\\nFY23 I just wanted to understand that in this business, is there some variability involved in other\\nexpenses because they don't change much as a percentage of revenues?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSulabh, this is Rajeev here. I'll take that question. So, like I said, we've had to restate financials\\nof the previous quarter to include SWC. So, what you see in terms of other expenses is more\\nlike-to-like. And hence, there is nothing in addition. We don't expect that the other expenses will\\nincrease or decrease materially. This pretty much reflects what is the reality of that business.\\n\\nSulabh Govila:\\n\\nSure. Understood. Maybe I'll take that offline. My second question is with respect to Plant\\nEngineering business. So, in the past 2 to 3 quarters, we've seen some volatility in this business.\\nWe saw a decline in Q3, and then we saw a sharp bounce in Q4, and we thought that the vertical\\nhas sort of recovered. Now the issues could be different in different quarters, but just trying to\\nunderstand that what's giving us the confidence that the volatility which we have seen in the past\\n2 to 3 quarters will not recur in the coming quarters?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSure. So, if I look back at our Plant Engineering and I'm scrolling through data as I look at it for\\nyou, right. If I look back at FY22, if I go back to FY22, and I see there was a constant increase\\nQoQ, every quarter, right? I come to FY23, and yes, there was a one-off decrease in Q3, but it\\ncontinued to the upward trajectory, right? And if I look at Q1 now, we've had a blip, and we are\\nsharing with you that some of these decisions – design decisions from the customers were\\ndelayed and it was not a budget issue. And therefore, with the backlog that we have got, the new\\norders that we have signed, with the rigor that we have put in, I do believe that this will be in the\\npast.\\nAdditionally, we are winning new digital factory and digital plant deals from customers in Plant\\nEngineering that give us the confidence that we will see upward trend from here. In fact, now\\nwe are adding some resources that we can immediately, hands on deck, to make sure we're able\\nto deliver. I also want to share that now we have established outpost in the US for clients in Plant\\nEngineering, that should help us in terms of engaging a lot more local talent, and the same will\\nbe happening in Europe. So, we’re fairly comfortable with it.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSulabh, this is Rajeev again. You may have seen, of course, our SEBI financials and tried to\\ncompare the other expenses for any variability. To clarify, in this quarter, there are lower\\n\\nPage 12 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nsubcontracting costs and of course, a lower legal cost as well and nothing to do in relation to the\\nSWC business. Again, I just wanted to add because it’s more like-to-like. I hope that clarifies\\nyour points on other expense.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nSo, when you look at the SWC business on the numbers that we have reported, is the Q4 to Q1\\ndip the usual sort of seasonality in the business. And typically, if you could give some color in\\nterms of typically what's the sort of the mix between first half and second half, how does it\\nnormally look?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nRajeev, do you want to take that?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSure. So, Nitin, to your point, yes, this business is seasonal in nature. Typically, you will see H2\\nto be better off compared to H1. In terms of mix of business, you will see H2 to be at 60% vs\\nH1 at 40%. So that's the reason we say that you tend to see H2 to be better off compared to H1.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nSure. And the variability from Q4 to Q1 that we have seen this time, is there a common feature\\nof this business? Or do you think as we – you spoke about, I think, one $30M and three $10M\\ndeals, as these deals keep adding up, that should sort of come off? How should we think about\\nit at least as we go over the next 12 to 24 months?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\n2 points here. One, the point that I made that H2 is better than H1, and hence, you're seeing that\\nQ4 had better off revenue for SWC when compared to Q1. That's one. Second, when you\\ncompare Q1 of this year to Q1 of last year, in fact, we have done better, right? I hope that clarifies\\nyour point, Nitin.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Vimal Gohil from Alchemy Capital\\nManagement. Please go ahead.\\n\\nVimal Gohil:\\n\\nMy question on SWC has been answered. Second question is on the industry per se. We have\\nseen a lot of influx or a lot of news on lot of global companies setting up GCCs in India. And\\nthere has been news of a lot of aggressive hiring from them. How do we participate in this\\nparticular trend? Do we partner with them in this entire process of setting up their centers? Or\\ndo we look at these GCCs as our potential competition?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSure. Vimal, thank you. So, I'm part of the – I just joined the NASSCOM Executive Council and\\nthe only ER&D company member on the council other than gentleman who's been co-opted\\nfrom the ER&D council. So here, GCCs are an opportunity. If I look back and I look at the\\nnumber of STEM graduates coming out of colleges in India, it's huge. It's more than 2 million\\npeople coming out per year in STEM, right? So, they will find their ways to Global Competency\\nCenters (GCCs)\\nNow here's the good news and the silver lining. All the business that was potentially going up to\\nUkraine or going up to Russia or going up to other parts of Eastern Europe has started getting\\nPage 13 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\ndiverted to India. A significant part of what was being given to China has been given to India.\\nSo, if I look at it, the India pie itself has grown, right?\\nSecond, if you would have talked to me 15 years ago, I would have said they are all competition.\\nBut I've learned, the industry has learned, everybody has learned to co-exist. In our customer\\npremises, often there are discussions that happen about green badge and red badge or blue badge\\nand red badge. Blue badge or green badge is their own employees, while red badges are people\\nlike us. They continue to look at – what is core, they will keep; whatever that could be contextual\\nor that was core yesterday could be given to us today.\\nAdditionally, GCCs focused on only their area of focus. So, an Automotive GCC will focus on\\nAutomotive. Telecom will focus on Telecom. But if they need cross-vertical domain expertise,\\nthey will not be able to deliver that. For example, I've been executing a number of connectivity\\nprojects for a lot of my Auto customers who have their centers here, but I work with their teams\\nin Europe and US, and they give me work directly, right? So that cross-vertical domain expertise\\nthat we bring is not there with GCCs because they are single cylinder focused.\\nLastly, the fact to be considered is that the world is moving to a lot more fixed price, consolidated\\nwork kind of model. So therefore, we are the gainers there because they look at us and they\\nactually let us deliver on an envelope basis rather than worrying about attrition etc. So, I do\\nwelcome GCCs being here. We've been hiring from them. They've been hiring from us. It's a\\ntwo-way street. I do welcome the whole ecosystem being built up in India because overall, it\\nadds to the fundamentals of the ER&D business and companies like us.\\nVimal Gohil:\\n\\nAmit, just a follow-up to that. How do you look at our cost structure versus the GCC cost\\nstructure? Is there a significant differential for our potential customers to say that the Indian\\nER&D service providers like us still have a better edge in terms of executing projects at a much\\nbetter cost efficiency versus them doing within their captive or in-house?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nVimal, 2 things here actually. Number one is that GCCs, their cost structures are higher than us.\\nThat's clearly the case. One, they work on a cost center model, and we work on a profit center\\nmodel, right. Two, because they are single cylinder, they can't offer a lot of career growth or job\\nenrichment to their software engineers or hardware engineers, etc., because they have to do the\\nsame work, and in our case, we are able to provide that.\\nSo, I will not say we pay less, our cost structures are lower. But if I look at the total package of\\nwhat we would be able to offer to our engineers, which is career growth, which is job enrichment,\\nwhich is job rotation, plus customer interactions, is something that we are able to provide that\\nare not there in an in-house setup. So, we do believe that's there. But having said that, I again\\nwill reiterate, together we are creating an ecosystem that is good for India and good for sourcing\\nfrom India.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\\n\\nPage 14 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nI just want to check on the growth in North America. It looks like we've seen some good revenue\\naddition there. It's almost as good as what we saw last year. So, what were the things that came\\nin well this quarter.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nRavi, Rajeev here, I'll take this one. So, it's more relative in terms of when you look at the growth\\nfor North America, and that's probably because we have restated the SWC financials in Q1 as\\nwell as in Q4. And because SWC is a cyclical business, you're seeing, of course, Q1 to be lower\\nrelative to Q4. And consequently, the proportion of business that you see shows a growth in\\nNorth America when compared, right? So, it's just relative. That's what I would say, Ravi.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nAnd Amit, on the semiconductor, we are starting to see the decision cycle get better. So, I want\\nto check, but you also said that you don't know if it's probably one quarter pain or more than one\\nquarter. So, could you just explain that?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nI'll answer it 2 ways, right? I will share but I will then request my colleague, Alind, to add to\\nwhat he's seeing in the market as well. One, from a Semcon standpoint, there is a little bit of pain\\nthat's there in terms of, you know, they are shifting; consumer electronic devices are not being\\nsold so much, so the demand is not there. They are all trying to switch to data center chips and\\nAI chips today. All of a sudden, AI is the only word they use, everybody uses, right, including\\nall of us.\\nSo therefore, there's a shift happening, in fact, and we see that spend coming. Now will that\\ncome in a quarter, will it be 2 quarters? To be seen. I would request Alind to add on the color of\\nthe market as he sees today in North America.\\n\\nAlind Saxena:\\n\\nSo, we have worked with more than one Semcon companies. Totally if you look at about 4 or 5\\nSemcon companies. If you look at the trajectory, which is broadly driven by AI and then by\\ndefault the requirements that the data center for them to be up and running, we see that\\ncontinuing. There are chips which are going to come in markets which are going to change\\nfundamentally the way that compute is going to happen. We are lucky that we are involved in\\nquite a few of them. We do believe that in about a quarter's time, we will see the growth trajectory\\ncome back up again, and we are confident of the progress there.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nAnd are you using those downturns or semiconductor to deepen your capabilities in any areas,\\nany white spaces maybe in the analog side or anything else where you think you lack?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, it's Amit again. From a capability standpoint, I do believe that we have capability across the\\nspectrum. We are working towards -- in fact, we've executed projects now on 7 nanometer (7\\nnm) chip as well, and we continue to work on different areas and are tying up with this global\\necosystem as well. So, we just have to start; some of these have to get signed off and start.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

I mean there are leaders from our SWC family that today are responsible for 2 of our\\ncenters in India, execution centers. There are leaders, senior leaders from the LTTS heritage\\nside, that are responsible for the nexGen communication business, which has been integrated\\nbetween both of them.\\nSo, we do commit to that 20% plus constant currency, and we are watchful that we won't sign\\nlower margin deals and that has been a conscious effort. And shall I say, cadence developed in\\nthe last 3 months in the company to ensure that. I'm confirming 20% plus constant currency, H2\\nbetter than H1. And broadly, the split will be what we have told you.\\n\\nSandeep Shah:\\n\\nOkay. So organic growth will also be more than 10%?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nAt this stage, 20% plus, yes, organic 10% plus and that's where we are. But you should know\\nthat both teams have merged and integrated.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Bhavik Mehta from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\\n\\nBhavik Mehta:\\n\\nJust one question from my side. Just going back to the guidance, how should we look at the mix\\nof growth within your portfolio? Do you expect all verticals to show strong growth going\\nforward, or do you think that some verticals will do better than the others and hence they will do\\nthe heavy lifting to offset weakness in maybe some other verticals. Just a color on that would be\\nhelpful.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSure. In fact, I'm going to answer this in 2 ways if I may. One, I'm going to give you an industry\\nview and then I'm going to ask my colleague here, Abhishek, to talk to you about what we are\\ndoing in SDV and AI because that's a huge path forward for us.\\nSo, from an industry standpoint and growth standpoint, I do believe that Transportation will\\ncontinue the strong growth we've had because of the differentiated story of EV that we have\\ncreated and the early investments in SDV that we are doing.\\nWhen it comes to Industrial Products, given the fact that we are seeing deal closures happening\\nfor us in digital as well as software platforms and people discussing AI in a very interesting\\nmanner for shop floor application for us. We believe that growth for that will continue, not\\nmaybe at the same rate of Transportation, but better than what we have done this quarter. We do\\nsee the growth continuing.\\nPlant, we do see the growth coming back next quarter and then continuing from there. Our\\nbacklog is fairly strong, and people continue to call us for designing of newer plants, expansion,\\n\\nPage 16 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\netc., and with this outpost we are creating in the US which has already been staffed, we are very\\nconfident that it will grow.\\nNow the two areas that I am a little conservative about – one is Hitech, even though nexGen\\ncommunication will continue to grow given 5G cybersecurity, I don't know how long the pain\\nin Semcon and Consumer Electronics will continue. I do believe it's a quarter off, but we don't\\nknow. So that's something that I'm a little concerned about at this stage and cautious is the right\\nword.\\nAnd finally, in Medical, we've had some good traction, some very nice dialogue around\\nconnected platforms, QARA, AI. But it's, again, how much do they want to give and do in the\\nsame quarter is to be seen. So that's where we broadly see it. I would invite my colleague\\nAbhishek, to talk a little bit about investments we are making in AI and SDV that will help us\\nin terms of growth as we move forward.\\nAbhishek Sinha:\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Amit. So clearly, with our customers, Amit earlier mentioned about the Advisory\\nCouncil, we are clearly seeing SDV, AI and Cybersecurity as the 3 legs – where we see a lot of\\ninvestments are coming in.\\nThe good news is, from a timing perspective – the SWC acquisition that we made the whole\\nNGC, next-gen communication skills that comes through that and the cybersecurity area are a\\ndirect fitment into the SDV space. And why I say that is because if you look at the software kind\\nof vehicle architecture, a lot of it is a high compute architecture and what that means is the skills\\nthat come from 5G, internet and such areas are directly relevant for the way the vehicles are\\ngoing to be designed. And interestingly, cybersecurity is a sweet spot for us because vehicle\\nSOC is something that need automotive skills and deep cybersecurity skills, and this acquisition\\ngives us both in a very nice way. And that is probably going to be one of the key differentiators\\nas we get into the space. I mean as we speak, we're already doing at least 4 or 5 SDV programs\\nfor most of the customers in Europe right now, and we see a decent pipeline on the SDV front.\\nComing to AI, our sweet spot there is going to be Manufacturing, Automotive and Medical. Here\\nalso, I think the domain expertise that we bring to the table – it's very clear that AI is not just\\ngoing to be about technology, it's about domain as well, and our deep domain expertise in these\\nareas definitely helps us take some good strides ahead. So we will be, of course, focusing on\\nthese 3 segments. But apart from that, the investments we have done over the last couple of years\\n– we have patents on some AI-specific solutions as well. That should help us. The work we do\\nwith hyperscalers, Semcon partners, I think this is a great recipe for different domain segments\\ncoming together to provide domain-specific AI solutions to customers.\\nIn both these areas, we are investing big time in internal trainings and the partnerships with\\nvarious entities in the ecosystem itself. And you will definitely hear more from us in the coming\\nquarters on these areas.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Rohan Nagpal from Helios Capital\\nManagement, India. Please go ahead.\\n\\nPage 17 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nRohan Nagpal:\\n\\nOne quick question on your India business, notice that there is a significant reduction in the -there's about a $10M reduction in your India business. Is it just on account of SWC seasonality\\nor what is going on here?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nYes, that's largely SWC. I don't see it another way.\\n\\nRohan Nagpal:\\n\\nOkay. And then one of the things you mentioned was the deals that you've signed have already\\ngone in for execution, they’re fairly swift. Could you provide some color on the timeline of deals\\nin terms of what is the typical timeline from signing to execution? And some color on the\\npipeline that you're currently seeing?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSure. When it comes to the deals that we signed, the $50M deal was something that we had been\\npursuing for more than about 4 months. And it took time and, we were waiting, we were\\ninvesting and waiting, right? And it took a lot of decision, approval, etc., to go through with that,\\nbut it's already moved to execution, and we have gone live. Now the other 5 deals that are there,\\nthe $10M+ deals, they have all gone into execution, I want to confirm, towards the last week of\\nJune, right, and ramping up as we speak and should get to steady state sometime in this quarter.\\nSo, we are continuing to work on those.\\nNow as an example, one of the Hitech deals that we signed, $10M+, not the $50M+, that took\\nus 3 months multiple meetings to sign. So, what we have done as a team is that we've improved\\nour funnel. We've increased the number of deals that we are chasing. We have hired more\\nsalespeople. They are on the ground and leaders as well. And I believe that, therefore, we are\\ncomfortable with the fact that we'll have to put in more effort to be able to do this. The moment\\nthe deal gets signed, right, the ramp up is fairly immediate. So, these are not long-term that they'll\\ntake 6 months, 9 months to do. Ramp up is immediate.\\nTherefore, we've beefed up our recruitment engine as well as well as Abhishek is very passionate\\nabout the Global Engineering Academy, which is also running full time to make sure that we are\\nable to repurpose people, turn them around, etc.\\nIn fact, in one of the deals that we signed, which was not a 1$0M deal because it's a shorter\\nperiod, we had invested in hiring and holding about 100+ resources for some period, and they\\nhave gone live now and billing. So, some of that training upfront, before execution, is required.\\nAnd we have more deals on the back of these that we are working on, we will continue to update\\nyou as we close them.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Mihir Manohar from Carnelian Asset Advisors.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nMihir Manohar:\\n\\nSir, largely wanted to understand on the synergy, which is the SWC acquisition. So, which are\\nthe internal KPIs that we are tracking? And how are we progressing on those KPIs -- that internal\\nKPIs, that will be really helpful. My second question was on the deal pipeline. I mean, you\\nmentioned the deal pipeline is quite strong, has improved materially. So, if you can quantify\\nwhat is the QoQ or a YoY improvement in deal pipeline that will be really helpful.\\n\\nPage 18 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nAnd specifically, which are the areas where you are seeing good deal pipeline in that context?\\nAnd my last question was just on the external environment. I mean you are appearing to be more\\noptimistic on the external environment when compared to your earlier commentaries. So, if you\\ncan throw some more color, I mean is the external environment worry just behind us? And how\\ndo you see the external environment per se? Yes. So those were the questions.\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSo, this is Rajeev here. Let me take the part on the synergies from SWC acquisition. So, we've,\\nof course, briefed this earlier as well – 3 areas that we are working towards. The integration did\\nconclude as of April 1, 2023, so both the companies are now together. And we are reporting\\nSWC under our Telecom & Hitech segment.\\nIn terms of synergies, 3 areas:\\nFirst, internationalization of revenue. Amit did talk about that we've beefed up our sales leaders\\nin U.S., in Europe, in Middle East. And clearly, the idea is to build pipeline. Some of that\\nprogress indeed has happened.\\nSecond is in terms of improving the EBIT margin. SWC has been a lower margin business, more\\nso because most of the revenue has been India-based, right? And of course, taking it international\\nwill help us getting comparable margins much like our heritage business.\\nThird is in terms of improving DSO. DSO because the deals that we're executing in India are\\ndeals that are like -- are with the government entities. So, as we do deals with global customers,\\nwe will see DSO terms closer to what we have in heritage LTTS business.\\nThese are the 3 areas. We'll continue to update.\\nWe did mention that our aspiration in terms of the combined EBIT margin is 17% levels. In\\nterms of DSO, the range that we maintained combined is between 115 to 117 and we will\\ncontinue to update on that.\\nOf course, Amit did reiterate in terms of the growth aspiration, which is 20% plus, including the\\nSWC acquisition. Amit, do you want to take the second one?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSure pipeline – where and its external environment. If I look at external environment, the fact\\nthat we are in 5 segments is what gives us confidence when one goes down, another goes up; It\\nis a portfolio. That's point number one. Number two, being an end-to-end engineering provider\\nfrom mechanical to hydraulic electrical to plant engineering to digital skills, and in that across\\nthe track from VLSI to hardware to software, firmware – all that gives us the confidence that we\\nare fairly in the right place.\\nNow having said that, I'll tell you where the problem is.\\nOne, the problem is that some of these deals that we are talking about, and we have chunkier\\ndeals like the $50M that we closed in our pipeline. So, the number of $50M+ deals, the $25M+\\ndeals for us at this stage is higher than it was last quarter, or same quarter last year. That is driven\\n\\nPage 19 of 20\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q1 FY24 Earnings Call\\nJuly 18, 2023\\n\\nby the fact that some of the investments we made in EV, some of the investments we made in\\ndigital manufacturing, some of the investments that we made in VLSI capabilities and digital\\nskills is coming to bear. Now, so that’s what gives us the confidence. Now the issue is, firstly,\\ninstead of 2 signatures, deals are taking 4 signatures. The reality, I will not shy away. I will\\nacknowledge it. I mean I should tell you the number of miles that Alind or even Rajeev,\\nAbhishek, our HR head Lakshmanan, is putting on in the last 2 quarters is much higher than they\\nwould have traveled over the last year because clients need that reconfirmation from the entire\\nmanagement team and not just one or two people, right. Secondly, in Semcon and Consumer\\nElectronics, like I said, there's a little bit of pain left. I cannot quantify for you how long, but\\nthat's the reality. Third, any project that doesn't have a profit pool or a revenue pool associated\\nand is being done for the love of mankind or womankind is getting delayed.\\nSo, these are 3 realities that are there. But having said that, we continue to be agile. We continue\\nto look at various areas like I requested Abhishek to talk about today on SDV and AI. We are\\nthinking ahead of the market, and I believe that these investments will carry us forward.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Aniket Kulkarni from BMSPL Capital. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nAniket Kulkarni:\\n\\nYes. So just a small question from my side. It is regarding the ROE number which you are doing\\nright now. So, are we comfortable at these numbers? Or is there any specific bracket where we\\nwant to be going forward?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nAniket, this is Rajeev here. So of course, you may be looking at ROE at a quarter level, but we\\ncertainly try to aspire for an annualized number. At this stage, we are comfortable in terms of\\nthe ROE, where we are or rather where we ended for FY23. The aspiration certainly is to improve\\nat the back of 18% EBIT margins by Q1 FY26. So, we believe over the period of these next 5-6\\nquarters, we should be able to improve the ROE. But at this stage, we are comfortable with\\nwhere it is.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take that as a last question for today. I would now\\nlike to hand the conference over to Mr. Pinku Pappan for closing comments. Over to you, sir.\\n\\nPinku Pappan:\\n\\nThank you all for joining us on the call today.

We also did our largest acquisition till date, which will\\nbe effective from 1st of April 2023.\\nI shall now take you through the details of our Q4FY23 and full year financials, starting with the\\nP&L.\\nFor the Quarter,\\nOur revenue was at ₹ 2,096 crores, a growth of 2.3% on sequential basis. Our double-digit YoY\\ngrowth trajectory continues with Q4 revenue up 19% on YoY basis.\\nWe sustained EBIT margin at 18.7% – flat when compared to Q3. We absorbed higher employee\\nrelated costs through operational efficiency and G&A improvements.\\nFor the Year,\\nOur revenue was ₹ 8,014 crores, a growth of 22% over FY22, our second consecutive year of\\ngrowing 20%+. Performance was led by Transportation, Plant Engineering and Industrial\\nProducts segments.\\nEBIT margin for the year was 18.5%, an improvement of 20 bps over FY22.\\nMoving to below EBIT\\nOther income for the quarter was at ₹ 39 crores, slightly lower on a sequential basis due to lower\\nforex gains.\\nEffective Tax Rate for Q4 was 28.0% and for FY23 at 28.6%, slightly higher than expectations\\nfor the year. This was due to conclusion of certain past year assessments in Q3, we expect this\\nto stabilize in the 27.5% range going forward.\\nNet income for the quarter stood at ₹ 310 crores, which is 14.8% of revenue, up 2% on a\\nsequential basis, driven primarily by higher Revenue.\\nFor FY23, Net Income was ₹1,170 crores, 14.6% of revenue, up 22%, in line with revenue\\ngrowth.\\n\\nPage 7 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

The combined DSO including unbilled stood\\nat 90 days, which is well within our target range of less than 95 days. This is also the lowest\\nlevel over the last few years.\\nLet me now talk about cash flows – In FY23, Free Cash Flow was ₹ 1,132 crores, a healthy 97%\\nof Net Income. Our Cash and Investments rose to ₹ 2,974 crores by end of Q4FY23, an increase\\nof nearly 40% vs end of FY22.\\nOn Capital Return: the Board today recommended a Final Dividend of ₹ 30/share, taking the\\ntotal dividend for FY23 to ₹ 45/share. This translates to a dividend payout of 41% for FY23 and\\nthe highest payout so far.\\nOur Return on Equity stands at 26% for FY23 vs 25% last year, again higher on account of\\nincrease in Net profit to ₹ 1,170 crores in FY23 versus ₹957 crores in FY22.\\nMoving to revenue metrics: On a sequential basis, $ revenue growth was 2.8% in reported terms\\nand 2.2% on a constant currency basis, led by Medical Devices and Plant Engineering segments.\\nSegment margin performance for the Quarter: was better in 2 out of 5 segments on a sequential\\nbasis. Transportation margins were lower in this quarter due to costs related to initial ramp up\\nof certain deals and certain one-time investments made in capabilities on new-age technologies.\\nSegmental margin performance for the Year: was better in 4 out of 5 segments, led by Plant\\nEngineering and Medical Devices.\\nNow let me comment on operational metrics:\\nThe onsite:offshore mix came in line with our expectations. Offshore percentage now stands at\\n57% for the quarter. Our aspiration is to improve this ratio to 60% levels in the medium term.\\nThe T&M revenue mix increased to 71% in Q4 and is likely to maintain at these levels.\\nOn client profile – which indicates the number of Million dollar plus accounts – has shown a\\nsequential improvement in the $5M and $1M plus categories. The client profile numbers have\\nseen an improvement over the past few quarters, this trend will continue in the coming quarters.\\nA key highlight that I would like to share here is that our top account crossed the $40M mark in\\nFY23.\\nClient contribution to revenue – All three categories – Top 5, Top 10 & Top 20 continues to be\\nin the same range as Q3.\\nHeadcount increased sequentially by 584 employees, while attrition moved down to 22.2%.

A couple of questions. Firstly, on the guidance. If I look at organic guidance at 10%,\\nseems a bit weak, given the momentum we have seen in four of the five verticals in the 4Q\\nnumbers. So can you just throw some more light on what kind of headwinds are you expecting\\ngoing into FY24, which has led you to come up with a weak guidance at 10% on an organic\\nbasis?\\nSecondly, on SWC, it seems like the revenues were just $100M in FY23, while the FY22\\nnumber, what you had shared, it led to revenues of around $140-150M. So, has SWC seen\\nrevenues contract over the last year? Just a clarification on that. And lastly, can you just talk\\nabout this DOJ settlement, what you paid of around $10M, more color on that in terms of what\\nis it related to some one or two clients or was it across multiple clients in the US? And what has\\nbeen the reaction from the clients because of the settlement done by you?\\n\\nPage 9 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nYes, hi. Thank you so much. Number one, I believe that what we've guided is 20% plus with the\\nfocus on the word ‘plus’, right? And we are just starting the year. We are not declaring FY24\\nresults yet. I do believe and I have a lot of optimism as I enter the year. If you look at it, there\\nare three clear areas where we're seeing money is being spent, Energy Transition &\\nElectrification, Digital – which includes Cyber, AI, Automation, Connectivity, Computation and\\nCloud adoption. And finally, a lot more outsourcing and offshoring.\\nSo at this stage, given where the world is right now, I do believe that we're very confident in this\\n10% plus across segments. The two areas which are a little bit of a concern to provide a balanced\\nview here or Semcon and hyperscalers. Our exposure to hyperscalers is very limited. And in\\nfact, the areas we're working with them on are seeing expansion. Semcon, of course we had a\\ndecline in the current quarter, but we overcame that. And in spite of that, Telecom and Hitech\\ngrew 4%. So that's where we are on that.\\nWith regards to the -- and I will hand over to Rajeev on the SWC part. But on the DOJ part, as\\nwe had outlined in the press release that we did, this was a settlement without admission of guilt\\nor liability. And this was for some stuff that came to our notice for the past. It is behind us. We\\nhave put in very strong controls, including having a general counsel appointed in the USA, and\\na strong team and processes to back this up. Our clients have been very supportive to us. And if\\nanything, what we have taken away is that they have appreciated our transparency, our strong\\nprocesses, and the way we have been working with them and conducting ourselves over the last\\nfew years. Rajeev, with that said, if you would like to add color on SWC.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nThanks, Amit. Bhavik, let me address the question on the SWC revenues. So in respect of SWC\\nrevenues, the portfolio of contracts that we've taken over from L&T aggregate to ₹ 800 crores\\nin revenue for FY23. We will consider this to be the baseline. These are also contracts that are\\nstrategic in nature and will result in better performance for LTTS combined in future.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nI would also like to confirm that the DOJ settlement has had absolutely no impact on any of our\\ncustomers or any deals or conversations.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Akshay Ramnani from Axis Capital. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nAkshay Ramnani:\\n\\nHi, thanks for taking my question. So, first question was on SWC. So, you mentioned about\\ngetting into asset-light deals. Would you expect that process to be a headwind on revenues as\\nwe transition? And if yes, how long do you expect the transition period to continue? And also\\nyou had earlier mentioned that some of these Government contracts have come up for renewal\\nover the next 18 months and in most likelihood you may not go ahead with renewing those\\ncontracts. So are we on track? And what percentage of revenues can those contracts be?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nOkay. Thank you so much, Akshay. Number one, as we have said, SWC is three parts.\\nThere is Telecom which now we have integrated completely into our Comms, and we are\\ncalling it Next Gen Comms. In fact, you see our website, may have either been changed or will\\nget changed from 5G to Next Gen Comms. There, we are seeing 2 areas of spend. 1) We are\\nPage 10 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nseeing a lot more 5G trials going on. And therefore our business in that area has picked up with\\na couple of old Telecom Operators that were our customers in North America. 2) There are\\ncustomers that are coming out with devices that can get rolled out into tunnels, into large\\nexpanses or campuses, etc. and they are asking us to test those devices, look at the hardware,\\nlook at the firmware, look at the software layer, etc. and we are again leveraging that. That is a\\nsecond sub-part of what's happening in Telecom Hitech. These are the asset-light deals that\\nwe're talking about with our pure play services that we're getting involved in globally. Like I\\nsaid, we announced one deal with 5G. We announced one today masking the customer's name.\\nAnd as I go forward, you will see a lot more exciting wins in this area because the pipeline is\\ngreat.\\nSecond is Cybersecurity. It was very small for SWC. It was a bigger part for LTTS. However,\\nthey had an asset called SOC – which is a Security Operation Center in Chennai, a physical asset\\nwhich we have taken over, which is basically a building with computers, algorithm etc. Now the\\nadvantage of all that is that we have already got 2 wins in that area. We are very close to getting\\na 3rd and 4th win in that area and signing up go-to-market partnerships with customers & with\\nproviders that will differentiate us. So that is again asset-light, a lot more to do with services.\\nThe Third part is Smart Cities. And there we are trying to diversify from Smart Cities to Spaces.\\nThat will include airports, will include campuses, buildings etc., and we were doing buildings\\nalready. Again, the whole goal is to move to a master software systems integrator, right? These\\nwill be deals that will have a bigger technology quotient and that's how we see this coming\\ntogether and we're very pleased with the progress we've made in the last two months.\\nNow the other thing on the Government contracts is that the Government contracts are all timebound. You do a project, you get an extension, you get the next bid and we are working through\\nthose as we progress.\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nI can add to that. Akshay, so most of these Government contracts, right? And in the current\\nbusiness, the entire revenue is on Government contracts. Now these contracts had a high Capex\\nelement to start off with and now we are entering into the Opex or the services part on these\\ncontracts. So when you talk about renewals, it is not that we will turn down the renewals. We\\nwill still do renewals more on the services part of it or the Opex part of it. So it should actually\\nbe a plus factor as we move ahead.\\n\\nAkshay Ramnani:\\n\\nOkay. Got it. If you can also touch upon will this transition period have a revenue impact? And\\nmy follow-up question is to Rajeev, you mentioned about getting to 17% margins in FY24. You\\nhad earlier talked about that 180-200 bps impact in Q1, also Q2 is a typical wage hike quarter\\nfor LTTS. So, does that heavy lifting happen in H2? Or how are you thinking about the quarterly\\nprogression of margins?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nNumber one, we have taken into account transition, the contracts that are ending, new contracts\\ncoming, pipeline, internationalization of the pipeline. In fact, the sales team for the entire SWC\\nrelated businesses have already been hired. They were brought on board right after we\\nannounced the acquisition in January and then we hired them in anticipation of closure. So,\\nPage 11 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nthey're already on board and already productive, right? So, we've taken all that into account when\\nwe've given you this 20% plus guidance. And as we go through the quarters and as things change,\\nwe'll continue to update you as we have always updated you.\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nAkshay, as far as margins, in the previous quarter, I did guide that we'll see an impact of about\\n180-200 bps on EBIT levels. I'm glad to share that it is now more narrow towards 180 bps. I\\nalready talked about that our aspiration for FY24 is to be in that 17% range. Of course, internally,\\nwe will continue to push for higher achievement. At this point in time, I'm just setting out what\\nis the more realistic part, but we'll continue to play as it goes around. Second part of it is the\\nincrements happen in Q2. So when I have shared this aspiration, it factors in the increment that\\nwill be rolled out in Q2.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. And congrats, sir, on a very good strong growth on a\\nbroad-based level. So, sir I think, Amit, I think I would just maybe touch upon this. I think after\\nmany quarters, we have seen such a broad-based growth almost across all the segments. You\\nspoke about, a bit about the Transportation vertical. So maybe a bit more on that, if you can just\\nmaybe give some light as to the reasons that we had QoQ dip in this quarter? And do you think\\nbasically this could reverse in the coming quarters or the weakness might continue for a couple\\nof them?\\nAnd a broader, larger-level question would be how are you seeing the overall demand\\nenvironment? We've always basically considered the ER&D spend as more discretionary in\\nnature, given the overall weakness and slowdown in the US and European economies. Are we\\nseeing any impact on the deal flow or conversations with the clients or in terms of the pipeline\\nthat we are looking at in the near future?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo thank you so much, Vibhor. Number one, I'd like to confirm, we don't provide QoQ guidance,\\nbut I always think of the investor community as part of the family and employee community of\\nthe company.\\nSo, I'm going to dispel this fear and tell you that our growth in Q1 as projected today for\\nTransportation is above 4% sequentially. So I want to just dispel that notion that there was a\\nproblem. What happened was that we had a jump in Q3 because some of our contracts started\\nand we requested our clients and they agreed that they wanted some work to be done quickly, so\\nwe ramped up extra there. And therefore, we stabilized, I would say, in Q4 is how I see it. The\\ngood news is that, you've seen the deal wins that we've had in the current quarter, they've all\\ngone operational. And I am confirming to you that growth is back in Q1 in Transportation for\\nsure, right? And we are already into Q1, right? If I look at demand, Vibhor, Electrification is a\\nbig spend area across US, Europe and Japan for Auto, and not just Auto, for Trucks and Off\\nHighway as well. And the new design cycle for Aerospace is starting up for hybrid aircraft. So\\nthat bodes well for that sector.\\n\\nPage 12 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nSecond, if I were to go to Industrial, people are asking the question two times when they place\\nthe order for sure, but we are seeing digital demand continuing to grow in that area as we see it\\ntoday. So I'm confident that this will continue into FY24 as well.\\nThird, I'll tell you where the issues are as well. So Hitech, Semcon, there's a little bit of stress in\\nthe system for sure. We've seen it in the current quarter. We will see it in the Q1 also, but it's\\nbeing overshadowed by spends coming out in the Telecom Operator and the Telecom OEM\\nsegment and M&E segment. In fact, there's a couple of interesting deals going on. Let's see when\\nit gets closed. But this will help us in growth in revenues in Q1 and beyond.\\nPlant, of course, continues to chug along. CPG – a lot more smaller plants coming up. In fact,\\nyou will be surprised a number of building, if you go and just get the data from the Government\\non the number of building permits and factory points that are being pulled by MNCs for India,\\nit's just, flowing off the wall and we've already won significant amount of MNC-based contract\\nto do engineering for their plants that they are building in India and Southeast Asia. And that\\nagain is a very positive sign. Oil & Gas, with oil prices where they are, continues to spend on\\nDigital Transformation.\\nAnd Medical is the only area where we didn't do well, right, in the last year. But given where\\nwe are in Q4 and the fact that now Europe and Japan – where we invested in these Geos for\\nMedical has opened up, I'm fairly comfortable.\\nSo net-net, I'm a little worried about Semcon and Hyperscalers. But our exposure to Hyperscalers\\nis not too much there. So, I believe that brick-and-mortar will prevail. As we always say, top\\nline – vanity, bottom line – sanity, cash – reality, you will see a lot of these companies doing\\nwell and coming to rescue in this current year of FY24.\\nModerator:\\n\\nNext question is from the line of Rajiv Berlia from Citi. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRajiv Berlia:\\n\\nThank you for the opportunity. I just want to understand what happened in other segments. We\\nsee a good drop in the other segment line item around 190 bps QoQ?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nRajiv, could you clarify your question, what do you mean by other segments?\\n\\nRajiv Berlia:\\n\\nOther expenses. So, in the other expenses segment, if I see, in the line item other expenses, I see\\na 190 bps drop on a sequential basis.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSo I think, Rajiv, what you're referring to are really the common costs that get allocated across\\nsegments. So, there was certainly a drop in terms of those common costs and largely, this is\\nbecause we had strong collections in the quarter which led to lower provision for doubtful debts.\\nSo that's what you see, Rajiv.\\n\\nRajiv Berlia:\\n\\nOkay. And similarly, in the employee cost, I see a 180 bps kind of a drop. And in the other\\nexpenses, I see 190 basis points of an increase. So, I just wanted to understand. So other expenses\\n-- so it's just that there is an increase of 190 bps and employee cost, if I see, there is a drop of\\n180 bps?\\nPage 13 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nSo two things on this, Rajiv. One, as far as the other expenses, this is to service some of the\\nprojects, we do increase third party contractors. And also, you could have some software costs\\nrelated to those projects, right? That leads to the increase in other expenses.\\nAs far as the employee cost, we continue to optimize on pyramid and a large part of that we've\\nbeen able to achieve QoQ through induction of freshers and those freshers go through training\\nand those freshers of course are then deployed onto projects, right? That leads to the reduction\\non the employee benefits cost.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Abhishek Shindadkar from InCred Capital. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAbhishek Shindadkar:\\n\\nHi, thanks for the opportunity. I might want to revisit that employee benefit expense again. So,\\nif I reconcile the expense line item and the cost of sales in your presentation, it appears, which\\nyou also alluded, that there was a higher subcontractor expense. So, could you just elaborate,\\none, was it for any particular vertical, if you can?\\nAnd the second is a broader question for Amit. So historically, one of the key strengths of LTTS\\nwas to kind of mine accounts and transition them from the lower buckets to higher buckets. If I\\nsee the recent presentation, it seems that we only have 1 $30M account versus 2 at the end of Q4\\nlast year. While the $20 million has seen an improvement. It could also be that one has come off\\nto the other bucket. Any changes that we need to do in terms of sales, presales, mining, which\\ncan help us kind of go back to the 2 or 3-year-ago period where we had a couple of $30M plus\\naccounts? Thank you for taking my question.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nAbhishek, let me address your first question. And I already talked about the fact that, look, on\\nemployee cost, we continue to optimize pyramid. And the other expenses, this is as a result of\\nincrease in third-party contractors and software costs related to projects. We can certainly take\\nthis offline, Abhishek, so that we can provide more colour and details. And to whoever else\\nwould like to understand, we can certainly talk about it offline. With that, I'll hand it over to\\nAmit to clarify on the top account.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nYes. So Abhishek, thank you so much for asking that question. Like I think Rajeev said in his\\ncommentary, I would like to confirm. See, we don't look at -- and I've shared this with a lot of\\nyou earlier in the past that I don't look at trailing 12 months, I actually look at annualized run\\nrate for the quarter and the past quarter to see as to where I'm heading with my accounts, right?\\nSo I would like to confirm to you that we have one account that is now safely sitting above a\\n$40M run rate, right? We also have a couple of other -- so there's three other accounts that are\\nclearly safely above the $30M run rate and then you see the accounts that are in $20–30M and\\nthen the $10–20M and the $5–10M. So, I clearly see that. If you wait for next quarter, you will\\nstart seeing some of that impact coming up in a positive way in the reporting as we do it.\\nAnd if you look at year-on-year, actually, as we have reported, you can see the $20M plus has\\ngone from 6 to 9, $10M plus has gone from 22 to 24. So there is a gradation improvement there.\\nWe continue to focus on account mining. We continue to focus on winning strategic new\\n\\nPage 14 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Clearly, the company is being run from a sales standpoint and account mining and\\naccount sales is two separate parts. And next time when we meet, we will definitely have Alind\\nmeet you as well and spend more time on this subject.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.\\n\\nApurva Prasad:\\n\\nThanks for taking my question. So, Amit Sir, first question is on the $10M plus TCV wins, even\\nfrom a full year point, it looks a lot lower versus where it was the previous year. So, is it any\\npart within the strategic bet or big spend areas as you highlighted earlier, which you don't see\\nplaying out as envisaged?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, Apurva, thank you so much for that. See, if you look at it, the last year, so if I compare FY22\\nto I compare FY23, I can confirm to you that the total TCV that the company has generated is at\\nsimilar levels or slightly higher because, you know, the base is higher, so slightly higher than\\nFY22. Having said that, you're absolutely right that the number of $10M plus, the double-digit\\ndeals, as we call them, is a tad bit lower. Right. So, I admit it. But the number of $5M plus deals\\nand the number of $2M plus deals that we have had, where there's a greater amount of ACV\\nimpact rather than TCV impact, have been higher for us. And that's how we've chugged along,\\nif you ask me, QoQ consistently at approximately 3%. But for Q3, which was shall I say, it was\\na quarter that had the perfect storm of furloughs etc. that came together.\\nSo I would not be worried. We are currently going through the process of making sure that as\\nwe come back to you next quarter, we continue to give you the guidance. But I can also tell you\\nthat some education has been needed on our part that $9M is not $10M and $8M is not $10M.\\nSo we are working through that right now.\\n\\nApurva Prasad:\\n\\nSure. And I have another question for Rajeev. Rajeev, this is on the segmental margin against\\nTelecom and Hitech, which has historically always lagged. So what would be your medium term\\nview out here in terms of convergence closer to company average post-SWC integration? And\\nthe second part is on your outlook for the overall DSO consolidated for next year and the OCF,\\nwhich was at about ₹ 1300 crores or OCF to EBITDA, which is 76%. How do you see that for\\nnext year?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSo, Apurva, let me take the Telecom margins first and then I'll clarify the other questions. On\\nTelecom margin, we've been at that 12.4% range, around that mark. Now, we may have clarified\\nthis in the past. A lot of our investments are stacked in the Telecom segment. The acquisition\\nthat we made of Orchestra Technologies, we still continue to record some costs on earnouts in\\nthis segment. That should taper down in FY24, which will help the margins go up. Having said\\nthat, with the SWC acquisition, we will likely see a reduction in margins. And that's again more\\nas an impact of consolidation than anything else.\\nWe believe this is going to be a segment that will flow business into the other segments. So you\\nshould take it to be where we do a lot of our investments in Telecom, which finally can evolve\\neither in a Transportation segment or it could evolve in a Medical segment or for that matter,\\n\\nPage 15 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nTelecom itself, right? It's likely that it will remain within this 10% plus range with SWC\\nacquisition.\\nSecond on the DSO – combined DSO – our aspiration for FY24 will be to come at a range of\\n115 – 125 days. And we will continue to optimize like we've done in case of LTTS. 90 days\\ncombined, both billed and unbilled has been by far the lowest in the last few years, and we will\\nlook at optimizing for SWC as well. So the range will be between 115 to 125 days. Apurva,\\nsorry, I lost your third question. Could you repeat that, please?\\nApurva Prasad:\\n\\nThat was on the OCF, OCF for next year, that's all.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nOn the Free Cash Flows, like I said earlier, for FY23, we came in at 97% Free Cash Flow over\\nPAT. Our endeavor will be to continue to optimize. We can come back to you on this. We have\\nstill not modeled it. But if I were to split between LTTS, I think our endeavor will be to continue\\nto look at, right, above the 80% plus threshold in terms of FCF to PAT. As far as SWC, with the\\nimprovement in DSO, we feel the FCF should improve. But we will model this and come back\\nto you in Q1.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nI would like to just say one more thing. We just want to be sure about this. And we had mentioned\\nthis in January when we announced SWC acquisition as well and I think Rajeev alluded to it\\ntoday as well. So there is a team that's been put in place that's working full time on making sure\\nthat the processes of both SWC and LTTS are harmonized and brought together.\\nPlus, as we have shown you over the last three years, that we have consistently improved margins\\nand DSO and free cash flow over the year. And that same process is being implemented for\\nSWC. And we are very readily agreed to it. And we are working together as one team. So we do\\nthink that we will be in a much better position as we move forward.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nNitin Padmanabhan:\\n\\nHi. Good evening. So, my question was around SWC. I think you mentioned that when the\\nCapex kind of revenue comes off, there will be continuity on the Opex kind of revenue. Well,\\none would sort of imagine that this would mean that the revenue goes off for a bit, but margins\\ndo improve. Could you shed a little light on that dynamic, please? So that's the first one.\\nAnd the second one, in terms of the three, how do we think about the globalization of these\\ncontracts, internationalization rather? So for that, typically, what would be the margins of the\\ninternational contract versus the 8-10% kind of EBITDA that we have for SWC? And typically,\\nwhat would be the size of these contracts roughly, just so that we're able to sort of understand\\non an ongoing basis how this sort of evolves over a period? Thank you.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nYes. Hi. Thank you so much, Nitin. Good evening. Number one, as Capex contracts, we look at\\nvery hard and seriously and only pick up ones that are adding value to our technology quotient\\nand journey. We are taking that all into account as we have given you the guidance for next year.\\n\\nPage 16 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nSo we have taken all that, what will ramp down, what will ramp up. We have done that math,\\nand that's how we have provided the guidance, right? Number one.\\nNumber two is that the Opex spends that are there, those contracts are at our constant margins,\\nso not to be worried. Now, in terms of globalization. I had written to about 100 customers I\\ntalked about last time, right after we did the acquisition, announced it. I got a very positive\\nresponse. We actually have hired the entire team that we needed to augment and hire and we are\\naveraging a good number of meetings on a weekly basis in terms of the interest areas, not just\\nfrom Telecom Operators, M&E and Telecom Infra companies, but our traditional customers,\\nbecause people are getting up and saying, we want to implement 5G, go after cybersecurity, etc.\\nSo we are definitely seeing that. In fact, Eaton coming out and making an announcement that\\nthey work with us on SWC itself is an indication of that.\\nSo therefore, I'm fairly comfortable in sharing that as we move forward in the quarter, you know,\\nsome of these guys are working on pure product development R&D. They may not want us to\\ndo a share of our news article or whatever, but we'll do our best to share as much as we can. But\\nI do believe that there's a clear path, like Rajeev has defined a path on profits optimization, DSO\\noptimization. There's a clear path to taking it to the global world, a path that Alind is leading\\nhimself, along with the CBOs that we have hired in that area to take it forward.\\nThe skills that they have got, so I shared this earlier, see about out of the 800 odd people that we\\nhave taken over from SWC – the family has come together, that's how we'll put it – about 600\\nodd people have got industry experience from the Hitech sector, and they were laterals that were\\nadmitted into the SWC family. So, I do believe there's the right kind of talent that can work\\ntowards offshore contracts, etc.\\nNow, what is the typical size of these contracts? The typical size of these contracts for Telecom\\nInfra & Operators will be in the same range as what we generate between, you know, that $5M\\nto $15/20/25M. If we're lucky, even signing a multi-year $50M contract, $40M contract. So,\\nright, right in that range. Cyber security contracts will be slightly smaller. They may be maybe\\nin the range of ACV being between $2M to $6M, but then there's a lot more clients that will take\\nadvantage of that. And therefore, the revenue can pick up very very quickly. So, that's where we\\nsee that going in terms of things. So, we're fairly comfortable with the trajectory of growth as\\nwe go forward.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Mihir from Carnelian Capital. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMihir:\\n\\nYes, hi, thanks for giving the opportunity and congratulations on the broad set of growth. I think\\nI largely wanted to understand on the offshoring side of things. I mean, you made an initial\\ncomment that you are seeing more offshoring happening in the coming years. So, if you can\\nthrow some examples, what is giving you the confidence that there is increasing offshoring\\nhappening? So, that was my first question.\\nMy second question was on the $40M contract that we have won. So, if you could throw some\\nmore light as to what is this contract exactly and then what the ramp-up happens for this\\n\\nPage 17 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nparticular contract. And the third question was on the SWC. Like, you know, when we see SWC,\\ncurrently it's a full Government business which is there, having a DSO of more than 400 days\\nand there could be some ramp-downs also.\\nSo, just wanted to understand, you know, what could be the dropout rate from the current\\nbusiness which could be there from SWC given the fact that we are looking at some dropout\\nhappening when the renewables would come? So, just wanted to have an understanding around\\nthat.\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo Abhishek, you have to cover the offshoring, then I'll take the next one.\\n\\nAbhishek Sinha:\\n\\nYes. So, on the offshoring front, like Rajeev had mentioned in his commentary, our mid-term\\naspiration is to go to about 60%. We are currently at 57%. Do we have the confidence? We\\ndefinitely are taking steps internally with our delivery leaders as well as sales leaders, putting\\nmore processes in place and engaging the customers to increase this. We believe that this is\\ndefinitely possible given where the world has moved from a hybrid perspective. Amit, you're\\nup.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nYes, sure. So, in terms of, I'll address SWC and then I will go to the $40M contract. So, the\\nSWC, look, as far as we are concerned, SWC will bring in that additional above 10% that we\\nare talking about for next year in terms of growth. And we have taken into account all these\\ncontracts that are ending, new contracts that are starting, etc. And we have done the entire math\\nand algorithm on that one and we are fairly comfortable with SWC bringing in right, profitable\\ngrowth, sustainable growth to us. I mean, that's our mantra.\\nNow, in terms of $40M contract, this is over 5 years like we have announced and actually is to\\nhelp product development and enhancement of this Transportation major that we have signed.\\nAnd this, we believe, will be a long-term relationship for us as we go on. It is a new customer\\nthat has been added to LTTS. And the exciting part is there is work on autonomous, there is\\nwork on electrification, there is work to be done on AI. In fact, there is a certain part of working\\non large language models. And I believe that this truly has much more potential than the $40M\\nthat we have announced. Again, you have known us for a long time. We want to be able to\\ncommit what we can deliver and deliver what we commit. So that's why we have gone with this\\n$40M number. Otherwise, the potential is a lot higher in this space. I would also like to confirm\\nthat this deal is already in execution as of Q1 with billing happening for the company. So that's\\nwhere that is. Thank you so much.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nI just want to add one point to address the DSO in SWC. Like I mentioned, we are running a\\nsynergy track, right? And DSO and Working Capital is one of the streams. So at least I wanted\\nto convey to everyone, we are mindful of the DSO of the current business. We already have\\nidentified areas, both from a process improvement standpoint and second from a mix of deals\\nthat have been either catered to within SWC or that likely will win in the near future to be able\\nto see that DSO coming down. So hopefully that should help you understand how we will address\\nthe DSO of this business going forward.\\n\\nPage 18 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  '©\\n\\nL&T Technology Services\\n\\nMihir:\\n\\nQ4 FY23 Earnings Call\\nApril 26, 2023\\n\\nSure. Just one last clarification. I mean, you know, if you can talk about like what is the revenue\\ndropout rate that you are considering for next year from SWC?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSo to give more color to what Amit talked about, all of this has been factored in the 20% plus\\nguidance that we provided. Amit mentioned about 10% plus coming from organic and the\\nremaining coming from SWC. All of this has been factored. So again, would like to give the\\nassurance that beyond this, we do not see anything that is going to be detrimental to the business\\nthat we have acquired.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, we will take that as a last question.

We are also seeing increased demand for cybersecurity as part of the\\nsoftware development platform work that we do.\\n\\n•\\n\\nFor Trucks & Off-Highway, similar trends of electrification and platform development\\ncontinue to provide us good opportunities. One of our 5 $10M deal is from this area.\\n\\n•\\n\\nIn Aero, driven by the rise in air travel, we are seeing demand for avionics. I want to\\nhighlight our selection by Airbus as a strategic engineering partner – This\\nempanelment is significant recognition of our Digital engineering capabilities and\\nAerospace domain knowledge.\\n\\nThe growth in Transportation will continue into FY24.\\n\\nIn Plant Engineering,\\n•\\n\\nWe were expecting a muted quarter, as we had indicated in our Q2 commentary.\\nHowever, the unexpected furloughs at some of our top customers led to a weaker than\\nexpected performance in Q3.\\n\\n•\\n\\nI want to highlight that this is a one-off and not a reflection of the demand\\nenvironment. We see growth coming back from Q4 onwards.\\n\\n•\\n\\nKey drivers of demand are localization of supply chains, sustainability in operations\\nincluding energy, water and waste management leading to greenfield/brownfield\\nexpansions.\\n\\n•\\n\\nIn the O&G/Chemical sub-segment, many of our customers are continuing to change\\ntheir product mix leading to design and digital engineering projects for us. One of our\\n$10M wins has been in this area.\\n\\nWe see a strong deal pipeline in both US, Europe and Middle East that will help drive growth\\nfor us in Q4 and beyond.\\n\\nAt Industrial Products,\\n•\\n\\nWe had a good growth in the quarter led by Electrical, Machinery and Power and\\nUtilities.\\n\\n•\\n\\nFor Q3, three of the 5 large deals that we won were in Industrial Products in the areas\\nof digital twin and sustainability-driven product development, innovation and\\nresearch.\\n\\n•\\n\\nWe see good demand in Digital Manufacturing to support automation and Software\\nplatform development to improve equipment performance and reliability.

We\\nreceived feedback and queries from you.\\nWe would like to acknowledge and thank you for the feedback. The queries were in three broad\\nareas:\\n1)\\n\\nHow are we going to achieve the turnaround of shifting the business to services?\\n\\n2)\\n\\nWhat are our integration plans and\\n\\n3)\\n\\nWhat is the roadmap for revenue/margins for this business and the company?\\n\\nI shall address the first one, and Rajeev will address the subsequent ones.\\nStarting with How will we achieve the turnaround?\\nWe go down to basics. SWC business is broadly, three parts, Communications, Smart Cities\\nand Cybersecurity.\\nOn Communications, which is a space in which LTTS has a solid presence – with a customer\\nbase of 6 of TOP 10 Telecom Infra OEMs and 4 of top 10 Telecom Operators in North America\\nand Europe. We are going to leverage this customer base and our global sales engine and reach\\nto sell these capabilities.\\nLet me divide the target market into two subparts. 1) Enterprise and 2) Telecom which includes\\nOperators and Telecom Infra OEMs.\\nWithin our Enterprise customer base, there is a demand for SOC, NOC, private 5G\\nand localized datacenters. The competition is also fragmented here and the spending\\nis also increasing. SWC now fills the critical gap of SOC, NOC and a greater and\\nstronger 5G capability. I wrote to our TOP 100 clients about the acquisition after we\\nannounced it, and 55+ clients have confirmed interest in our expanded service\\nofferings. In addition, we will leverage our partnerships with Qualcomm, Nvidia and\\nMavenir as well as our other hyperscaler relationships to penetrate the market faster.\\nWithin Telecom, there are huge spends around network engineering where we now\\nhave both scale, onsite offshore model to offer cost arbitrage and track record or prequal as it's known in the industry - which is extremely critical in discussions and large\\ndeal processes. We will also work with our Indian customers and offer a more service\\nled model around Core and RAN capability with the expertise that SWC and LTTS\\ntogether possess.\\n\\nPage 7 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nIn summary, for Communications, the LTTS heritage portfolio of around $60M combined with\\nabout $100M from SWC will together be a $160M business unit, henceforth referred to as\\nNext Gen Communication. Both portfolios will grow going forward. The heritage LTTS\\nportfolio will see accelerated growth as we offer SWC capabilities, while the SWC portfolio will\\nkeep growing at a slightly less pace as we change positioning to more services, for which the\\ncurrent pipeline and client relationships gives us a lot of confidence. The joint power of\\nsolutioning 5G use cases across a broad spectrum and technical assets like the gEDGE data\\ncenter, 5G lab-as-a-service gives us the confidence that the combined portfolio will be\\ntransformed to be largely Service-led.\\nMoving to Sustainable Spaces\\nSWC brings capabilities in Efficient Campuses and Cities, Utilities, Mobility, Public Safety and\\nEnvironment, while we have expertise in smart buildings. LTTS has tie-ups with Microsoft and\\nother hyperscalers.\\nWe have consulted experts who have validated that there is a sizable spending due to COP27\\ncommitments from governments in US, Canada and Europe. We also spoke to our Top 100\\nclients who have expressed interest in our joint capability that they would like to leverage in\\ntheir plants, to improve their sustainability and digitization quotient.\\nSWC's Fusion platform, coupled with our i-BEMS and UbiqWeise platforms along with their\\nsoftware foundry in Hyderabad will help us accelerate solutions that can be commercialized for\\ncustomers. Additionally, their integrated command and control centers that have been built\\nfor cities is a real differentiator for us.\\nWe will take SWC solutions to the US and Canada and select countries in Europe, Middle East\\nand Asia, leveraging our existing footprint. We will have a direct sales team as well as leverage\\nour extensive Partner network to expand these markets.\\nWe will have a combined portfolio of around $40M, which is ~$30M from SWC and $10M from\\nheritage LTTS. We expect an accelerated growth for the combined portfolio as we target our\\nenterprise customers and new markets that are ready for such solutions at scale and transform\\nfrom a master system integrator to a master software solutions player in this space.\\nFinally, on Cybersecurity,\\nWe will leverage the SOC in Chennai from SWC along with the talent that both of us have\\nrecruited in respective companies. We have multiple ongoing engagements in Cybersecurity and\\nthe SWC team and leadership is a shot in the arm for us at the right time.\\nWith SWC, we will be uniquely positioned to offer full lifecycle threat management, OT,\\nProduct, IIoT and enterprise security.\\nWe are looking at almost tripling our combined revenues of $10M currently, over the next 2\\nyears.\\nPage 8 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe first question is from the line of Bhavik Mehta from JPMorgan.\\n\\nBhavik Mehta:\\n\\nA couple of questions. Firstly, to Amit. If I look at what happened in 3Q, was it just a function\\nof furloughs or whether also cases where, let's say, a lot of the deals you had won over the last\\neight to nine months did not ramp up as per your expectations? And how should we look at 4Q\\nthen, what are you hearing from clients when it comes to conversion of those deals into revenues\\nso that's one.\\nAnd secondly, to Rajeev on 3Q performance on margins despite flat growth. So outside of SWC,\\ncan we expect 18.5% as a new base of margins going forward? Or do you think that 18% is the\\nnormal range to look at outside of SWC?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, number one, I am confirming that Q3, you see normally, if you look at Q3, it has a lesser\\nnumber of working days, right. I mean that's about, if I may be exact, I am an engineer & that's\\nthe problem we want to be exact. So about 3% lesser working days are there. So, we know that\\nand that's how we had said we'll have a muted quarter.\\nWe got hit by additional furloughs as we call it, because there were customers that came back\\nand said that they would like to slow down the projects, etc. in Plant Engineering. But the good\\nnews is that they've since come back and they confirmed at the time when they were slowing it\\ndown that it will come back up on January 2nd onwards as 1st is holiday. And it did ramp back\\nup from January 2nd, the team started again.\\nSo therefore, it was a furlough impact more than anything else, and that's how I would leave it.\\nFrom a deal velocity standpoint, I will say similar TCV, 3-digit of total deal closures that we\\nhave had. We are happy to share that the $10M+ deals that we have had. So, three of those\\nclearly in Industrial Products, which is a high-margin business for us, one of them in Plant\\nEngineering, which is again higher margin and the fifth one in T&OH for us, so which is\\nTransportation.\\nWe've had that plus there are multiple $5M deals that we have signed in Medical, in Telecom\\nand Hitech, etc. Deal velocity is similar & we talked about the empanelment as well, and that\\nalso came through last quarter, so I do see that. In fact, I do want to say that other than Hitech,\\nwhich we have called out in my commentary, the three sub segments that are there, we are seeing\\nproject approvals and continuation of teams, etc. In fact, we have done well on utilization last\\nquarter. What we've done is that we've again given you a number, quantified the least possible\\nincrease in headcount. We're fairly comfortable at this stage. Now with that, Rajeev, margins?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nIn respect of margins, Bhavik, I just would like to say a few things. One, if you look at across\\nall the five segments, we are certainly showing improvement in terms of EBITDA. I think the\\noperating model that we've been talking about in the past, including the economies of scale has\\nplayed out quite well for us.\\nWe remain fairly comfortable that we should be able to hold for LTTS, the margin improvement\\nthat has come about. I did indicate that with consolidation of SWC in Q1 FY24, we should see\\n\\nPage 10 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\na dip of 180-200bps, but that's something that would have been with any acquisition. But to sum\\nit all, the operating model, the economics of scale have played out well for us. That gives us the\\nconfidence in terms of maintaining the margin going forward.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak Securities.\\n\\nKawaljeet Saluja:\\n\\nJust a couple of questions. The first is on demand. Amit, you did mention that the demand impact\\nis largely furloughs, but when I look at your guidance, the guidance cut is $5M to $15M in\\nrevenues, whereas basis of furlough impact, the impact should not happen more than $2M to\\n$3M\\nSo just trying to reconcile some basic numbers behind the guidance cut. Is there more to it rather\\nthan just furloughs, which would have led to a change in your guidance that's the first question.\\nThe second question is more on relative comparison. That's something which I hate relative\\ncomparison but tempted to ask this for the first time. When I look at a company based in Delhi,\\na company, which has a business mix and portfolio similar to yours, they seem to be doing better\\non the far larger scale on growth.\\nWhereas LTTS, despite strong win announcements had continued moderation in growth rate. So\\nis there any, I mean, shift in share or loss of share, which one needs to contend we're probably\\nworried about in your case. So yes, those are a couple of questions, I’d appreciate it if you can\\nanswer them.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo, the change in guidance, we are saying we'll deliver 15% is basically based on muted Q3. So\\nthat's where that is, and that's where that stands. Now in terms of comparison, it was a specific\\nPlant Engineering issue that I believe is since resolved. But of course, finally proof is in the\\npudding. You will see that at the end of Q4 when we come back and declare that to you.\\nI would, in fact, say that if I look at our market share and our size that we have got going on, I\\nthink we are expanding with our clients. In fact, if I look at the total number of clients itself, if I\\nlook at it year-on-year, I would say we've gone from 318 clients to 343. And you've seen a\\nnumber of clients growing in the $1M bracket, the $5M bracket, the $10M, the $20M as well as\\nthe $30M.\\nI also want to add that I have visibility to the current run rate that we think we'll end up in Q4.\\nAnd I can confirm to you that market share has expanded rather than declining. We were not\\ngetting invited to certain Telecom specific RFPs in network engineering given the size of the\\ndeals and what we had as capabilities in spite of buying Orchestra Technologies and growing\\norganically, so we went in for this (SWC acquisition).\\nI do believe that we stand in a position now, having crossed $1B revenue in constant currency\\nand with now with Smart World, I do believe that we are head-to-head with a lot of people that\\nare there and our aspirations to get to $1.5B, as confirmed by Rajeev FY25, remain.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe'll take the next question from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\\n\\nPage 11 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nMukul Garg:\\n\\nAmit, I just wanted to follow up on the guidance part only. We have seen historically, you tend\\nto be fairly conservative when you provide your revenue growth guidance like generally not like\\nto kind of cut it back as you had to do this quarter. There is obviously this is happening in the\\nbackdrop of the macro constraint which you are seeing across the board.\\nAre there any signs which have now started becoming visible whether the increased furloughs\\nin Q3 also were a factor of the macro pressure and does this increases the risk to how you are\\nkind of visualizing qualitatively despite FY24 spend from corporates?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nI want to give you a long-ish answer, if you don't mind here. So, let's go segment-wise. When\\nyou look at Transportation, right, we have not seen any moderation in spend. In fact, we've seen\\nthe growth in that as well in spite of a, shall I say, smaller quarter seasonally. And we do see\\nnew programs kicking in, etc. And that's across Auto, Aero and T&OH. Industrial Products is\\nspending in specific areas of digital manufacturing as well as digitization of their products and\\nthat continues to happen, we don't see any slowdown. You've seen that in the growth as well as\\nour commentary for Q4.\\nNow Medical that you have has always been traditionally, the work we do, a very conservative\\nsector. But given the QARA pressures that they are under and notices they're receiving from\\nvarious agencies and their need to check that, etc, as well as digitalization, we are seeing spend\\nand you will start seeing that growth, right? Fourth is Hitech. I will say this that there are five\\nsub segments in Hitech. There's ISV, there is Consumer Electronics (CE), there's Semiconductor,\\nthere is Media & Entertainment (M&E) and then there is Telecom. We have not seen any cutback\\nin Telecom, which is Infra and OEMs or in M&E. However, in ISV, CE and Semiconductor,\\nwe've seen a fair degree of caution that they were exercising last quarter also & this quarter also.\\nBut we believe that the growth in Telecom and M&E should be able to overcome that. In\\nMedical, forgot mentioning one thing - Healthcare is investing.\\nFinally, come to Plant Engineering. Like I said, again, Plant was a one-off issue in the quarter\\n(Q3), since addressed. I'm going to assure you that the Plant Engineering will come back in Q4\\nand beyond. We are actively hiring, ramping up in Baroda and Chennai as well as in the US and\\nEurope for this particular segment.\\nSo that's how I see this. Finally, other than parts of Semiconductor, ISV, CE, mostly, you see a\\ncompany-specific cut in terms of spending, but not a sector-wide. So, I'm still cautiously\\noptimistic about CY23.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe'll take the next question from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities.\\n\\nVibhor Singhal:\\n\\nSo, two questions from my side. Amit, you mentioned, I mean, we saw a very strong growth in\\nthe Transport division in this quarter. And we also had all these deals with the Airbus as well.\\nSo just wanted to basically understand the traction that we are seeing in the Aerospace division.\\nWe've seen travel rebound significantly across the globe.\\n\\nPage 12 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nAnd is it that kind of leading to more traction in this division? And do you think it can sustain\\ngoing forward in the next year, I mean, as an industry, do you think there could be more similar\\nkind of deals either for us or for the industry as a whole in this segment over the coming quarters,\\ngiven that most of the Airlines’ profitability and other values are basically now into the green\\nagain, and they might start spending again on both the fronts.\\nSecondly, my question was just a big basically, a quick clarification of the SWC margin thing.\\nAs we have mentioned that the first quarter of next year, we will see a 180-200bps impact of\\nmargins. Would there be any non-recurring impact of that as well? Or is it just the integration,\\nwhich is going to reset the margin to that level? And then gradually, we're going to wrap it up\\nas the growth comes in and as we basically rationalize the operations. So that's the two questions\\nfrom my side.\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nOne on Airbus, I do want to acknowledge one thing. Dr. Panda, as you're aware, is an Aerospace\\nengineer & this account is very close to his heart. So, we did start trying to pursue this while he\\nwas CEO. And I'm happy that after years, we got empaneled first as a provider and then got\\nselected. In fact, he was in our Board meeting today, and he said one thing – “you delivered very\\nnicely done.” It has been a dream, right? So, I do want to say for an aerospace engineer, getting\\nAirbus empanelment for digital manufacturing etc. is a dream. I do think and a lot of people to\\nthank, compliment, etc.\\nHaving said that, I'll tell you Aerospace, the spend that is coming back is one there are design\\ncycle that is starting again for the next-gen aircraft, right? People are looking at smaller aircraft,\\nthey're looking at single aisle. There are people that are talking about it. You can read the press\\non that. There is hybrid aircraft that people are talking about, etc. So those design cycles, concept\\ncycles are starting. These are generally about a seven-to-ten-year cycle, right? So that is starting\\nup. So that's good news, number one & this is not just for us, but everybody. So you will see\\nmore spend coming out for structures or avionics, etc.\\nSecond, what's happening is there is a technology conversion happening from mechanical to\\nelectric, power electronics, et cetera, within the existing aircraft. That again is a smaller cycle,\\nthat's about maybe a five-year cycle. So that's kicking off as well. So that's number two.\\nNumber three, the digital manufacturing part that they are bringing to a shop floor for a more\\nintegrated delivery, full life cycle system as they deliver aircraft and people take deliveries. So\\nthat is what is happening.\\nSo you will see spend in Aero growing as you move forward, right? So that's that. In fact, one\\nmore thing was that you remember at one time, Japan, they were trying to do something and\\nthey stalled it because of COVID, again starting to have conversations where it should come\\nback, et cetera. So a lot of positivity in that sector that I believe gives a lot of breather to a lot of\\npeople.\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nLet me take the question on the consolidation impact. In the previous analyst call, I did indicate\\nthat the SWC margin is in the range of 8% to 10%. So, Q1 truly is the impact of consolidating\\n\\nPage 13 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nthe two financials and of course, the impact in terms of acquisition, etc. But from thereafter, it\\nis going to be a progressive improvement, looking at both revenue synergies and cost synergies.\\nWhat we believe is quarter-on-quarter, you will see that progressive improvement coming\\nthrough, which is where our aspiration is to come back in terms of 18% EBIT in H1 of FY26.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nWell, two questions. First, within transportation, would you say that at least this year,\\nAutomotive is\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nSorry to interrupt you, please use the handset mode. The audio is not clear.\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nSo within Transportation, would you say that Automotive is the fastest-growing this year,\\nfollowed primarily by Off-highway with Aerospace a little further behind. Amit from the way\\nyou sounded it looks like Aerospace is going to pick up. So how should we think about growth\\nwithin Transportation overall for CY23?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nRavi, can you repeat that, please?\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nI was saying within Transportation over this year, would you say that Automotive was the fastest\\ngrowing and maybe followed by Off-highway and Aerospace further behind? And how should\\nwe think about CY23?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nNumber one, Transportation did grow, right? And let's wait for April to conclude which grew\\nthe fastest and slowest. But I will say this to you that for CY23, see, there are a few trends that\\nwe definitely see happening.\\nA) One is a lot more electrification of Automotive, so that will continue. Companies, however,\\nhave to remain profitable to be able to spend. B) T&OH - Construction of highway is seeing\\nadded autonomous as well as electrification and connected spend coming in. So, that is definitely\\nhappening. C) Aerospace, we believe, is starting a design cycle, but more than mechanical, we\\nbelieve this will be more avionics and electrification, etc. led and digital manufacturing led. The\\nreason I make that point is that earlier design cycles used to be a lot more mechanical led. This\\ntime, we are seeing a change in that. And we believe that we are well positioned in that area\\nbecause we are more electrical embedded driven than mechanical driven in this area. So overall,\\ndo I see the growth? I absolutely see good growth coming in this area, continuing in CY23\\n\\nRavi Menon:\\n\\nAnd a follow-up on the Telecom & Hitech. you mentioned that in ISV, there was some pressure.\\nSo how should we think about this? Will ISV shut down some of these older legacy products\\nthat should we say - do we see a hit? Or do you think that more shifts offshore will actually\\ncompensate for that or maybe even provide some growth?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSee, for those that have followed us two years now and talk to us, ISV is one of our smaller sub\\nsegments, right? Our exposure to ISV is fairly limited from a hit standpoint. Having said that,\\nISVs are reconsidering their spends. There was a lot of pie in the sky ideas and projects that were\\ngetting talked about. All that definitely is taking a back - shall I say back bench because they\\nPage 14 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nalso want to start delivering profit, they want to look at, etcetera. So that's there. But Telecom &\\nHitech, I do want to say that 5G spends are on and will continue to do that.\\nSecond, ISVs are trying to stop some area of spending, but they are starting to spend in devices\\nthat they are building that will work with 5G and then tomorrow, 6G, WiFi 6, etc. So I do believe\\nthat, that part will continue to grow. I am hopeful Semcom will definitely come back because\\nthe amount of semiconductor required in Auto that's required in data center is there. Yes, the\\nnumber of people buying laptops has gone down because all of us purchases a laptop they wanted\\nto & going back to work now.\\nBut having said that, it's just temporary because if you look at the kind of production capacities\\nthat companies are building and design there are talking about, I do believe it will come back.\\nSo overall, I do think that the Hitech recovery may start in the second quarter calendar year and\\nthen go up from there. That's how I broadly see it -- for us specifically, though my commentaries\\nhold that I do see our Q4 Telecom & Hitech being better.\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe'll take the next question from the line of Sulabh Govila from Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nSulabh Govila:\\n\\nSo a couple of questions from my side. One is on the Auto vertical, particularly, which has been\\ndoing well for us as well as industry as a whole. There seems to be no major wins listed this\\nquarter, but so I just wanted to understand, has there been a change incrementally in the way\\nclients are awarding deals? Or is it just a timing issue in this quarter? And the second is on the\\n$30M client bucket, there's a moderation in that number QoQ. So, is that also related to the Plant\\nEngineering related furloughs or that's related to some other client?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nThe number one, Auto, not having a single $10M deal. Again, I said this to some of you once\\nthat engineers think like engineers, they don't think like businesspeople, they don't know that\\n$9M is not counted in $10M deals. I would confirm to you that there are deals in Automotive as\\nwell. In fact, there are incremental deals. I don't know whether we’ve made it press or not. There\\nwere a couple of new ODCs inaugurated in this last quarter. Maybe - they have asked us for\\nnames to not be published, so we didn't, but there are a couple of new ODCs that have been\\npublished.\\nThere were earlier wins that have ramped up in Auto as well. There are some exciting deals in\\nprogress in Auto as well. And I believe that some of them, they're already closed or are closing\\nin the current quarter. So, I would not be worried about not announcing a deal in Auto. I was\\nfocused more on making sure that we get - because last quarter, we got feedback on this, the\\n$9M is $9M and it’s not $10M. So, we made sure that there are some deals between $10M,\\nnearly close to $20M also. But we haven't called them out as $20M because we believe in the\\npractice of being a little conservative on these things. But I would not worry about Automotive\\n-- all I would say is that we continue to grow in this area, expand, hire, etc. Now in fact, we are\\ndoing walk-ins in Munich. So, anybody who has friends can even recommend people and in\\nBangalore & Mysore.\\n\\nPage 15 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nNow let me go on to the $30M. I agree with you that that $30M, there was one client, in fact,\\nless in sequential LTM,. In fact, not just $30M, we were flat in $20M as well. Though $10M+\\ngrew one sequentially and $5M grew one sequentially. And of course, $1M grew by 8.\\nSo I have access to Q4 data, which I expect we will do. And you will see some of these furloughs\\ndid have an impact across, right, everybody there was a shorter quarter, etc. So, what I can\\nconfirm to you is that this will correct itself. As we move forward, our focus on account mining\\nscale continues to be laser sharp so that we can expand.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Mihir Manohar from Carnelian Asset Management.\\n\\nMihir Manohar:\\n\\nLargely, I wanted to understand on the North American geography side, I mean, North America\\nhasn't grown for this particular quarter. So any signs of demand moderation across this particular\\ngeography? I mean your comments with respect to this geography. That will be helpful. And my\\nsecond question was on this Airbus notification that we made. Earlier also, we were like a\\nstrategic engineering partner, and now we are there for advanced capabilities. So just wanted to\\nunderstand, given the fact that our penetration and our capabilities are improving on the Aero\\nside. So, what kind of spend could be there for us specifically over the next year from the Aero\\nside? I mean could it be like $5M kind of a spend per quarter? Could that be the potential\\nopportunity? So I wanted to understand that.\\nAnd my third question was on the guidance that we have given the 15% constant currency\\nguidance that we have given, and it implies 4.5% to 5% kind of a growth for balance part of the\\nyear. So, I mean what is bringing us that confidence that given a muted growth this quarter, we\\nare still hopeful about having 4.5% to 5% growth for the balance part of the year? Yes, those\\nwere the questions.\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo Mihir, here are the answers. Number one, you can see that North America, actually, there\\nwas a 0.7% de-growth it shows here because of this revenue, the way we count currency, but\\nIndia shows 6.4%. I can confirm to you that we don't work in India, right? Largely, our India\\nrevenue that we report is actually INR billing, but it is done for US and European customers. So,\\nI would like to confirm to you that Europe, North America - both of these and ROW have grown,\\nthe India growth that you see, you should actually count it towards the 3 Geos because for India,\\nwe do very little, maybe some $1M/$2M per quarter to that extent, $3M. So please read it like\\nthat. In fact, next year, we will review this and see if there's another way to present this because\\nwe get asked this question every quarter. So, we'll review this.\\nSecond, Airbus. See, please understand, Airbus is a very -- shall I say, -- I want to find the right\\nword for you. They have a very process-oriented methodical empanelment exercise, etc. So,\\nwhat happened last time around when we announced it was we have been chosen by Airbus for\\nSkywise platform and they had empaneled us as a vendor and given us MSA, etcetera, signed\\nglobal really, which was earlier only in India MSA.\\nNow what they have done is, specifically in digital manufacturing and the other area, they have\\nqualified a spend and said we will spend X amount of money, and we have been empaneled as\\n\\nPage 16 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\none of I again can't give a number who are not liberty by Airbus to do that, but one-off say N\\nnumber of suppliers and N is a very small number. So, they will spend that XX dollars amongst\\nthose very little vendors in those two particular areas. They've in fact given us a ramp-up plan,\\netcetera.\\nThe reason I am again not quantifying it is because that is a discussion we've had with Airbus\\non. But I'm fairly confident that it will ramp up. We actually started recruiting, training, etcetera,\\nas well as building team organization structures, etc. I will actually request my colleague,\\nAbhishek, our COO, to talk a little bit about the process he does to get ready for such ramp-ups.\\nThird, Aero do we see growth? In avionics and digital manufacturing. Lastly, guidance, 15%\\nconstant currency amounts to more than 3% growth as far as we are concerned. And a point was\\nasked earlier, were we slowing down. So see, we were at about a 4% growth rate in last year,\\nand we had done that whatever, 19% to 20% that we grew last year.\\nThis year, we've been a 3%+ range. Quarter 3 was muted. And next quarter, we see it's not played\\nout yet. That's why we give guidance and let's say, don't give a firm number. We still have to\\nbill, we still have to invoice, to collect. I can assure you that it will be greater than 3%. Will it\\nbe 4%, will it be more is to be seen.\\nAbhi, would you like to add on Aero specifically what we're doing in terms of that?\\nAbhishek Sinha:\\n\\nI think you all would have heard about the center we opened in Toulouse about 4 months back.\\nAnd no one invests in a center in France, if they don't have the confidence of growing in the\\nregion, and it was for Airbus, and that's the reason we opened that center. If you look at of course\\ncan't share number, but if you look at our growth, of Airbus in the last couple of quarters, it has\\nbeen actually one of the fastest-growing accounts for us.\\nAnd this is all in the backdrop of a very structured academy program that we have, training\\nprogram that we have created in partnership with the Airbus all our training materials, the way\\nwe go about it, there’s an engine running and how we hire people and train them & internally\\nmove people into the account. Our relationship with Airbus is at a very advanced very\\nstrategically placed. We have even won some awards again can't share details. But I think we\\nare in a good space and this partnership that Amit spoke of that we won the empanelment. I think\\nthat augurs well for us in the digital manufacturing space, especially.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe'll take the next question from the line of Akshay Ramnani from Axis Capital.\\n\\nAkshay Ramnani:\\n\\nSo, first question was on offshoring. So, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that we see\\noffshore revenue mix going up to 60%. I wanted to understand what are the drivers of this trend\\nand which are the verticals where we expect this to be play out?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nSo let me start by sharing the verticals, and then I will request Abhi, my colleague, COO to\\naddress the drivers for offshoring to increase. From a vertical standpoint, see, as you look at it,\\nwe expect it to be, and I want to say this, you'll see this across verticals. It's not a vertical or a\\nsecond vertical, you'll see this across verticals. I would also say that digital engineering – digital\\nPage 17 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\nproducts and services as well as embedded, testing, parts of digital manufacturing. We'll see this\\na lot more, right? So, it's across. It's not like it's one or the other. Abhi, would you like to give\\nthe drivers for offshoring? Traditionally.\\nAbhishek Sinha:\\n\\nYes. I think when we looked at our operational strategy, while everyone knows utilization\\nfreshers pyramid, these are all usual levers that you look at for margin growth. But offshoring is\\nprobably one of the biggest levers that we have, as a company, decided to work on. Our nearterm aspiration is to go to 60% of our revenue coming from offshore. And we know that, that's\\na big lever from a margin perspective.\\nOne of the things we have done well this quarter and hope to continue to in the coming quarters\\nis a very high degree of focus on fresher utilization. The freshers that we take every quarter\\nanywhere between 500 to 600 freshers that we take every quarter. Not only do we make sure\\nthat they are ready to get into billable projects that helps in margins, but more importantly, that\\nalso help in pulling more work offshore.\\nThe last point I would like to mention is we have very actively started engaging with our\\ncustomers in pushing the work to offshore, we have kind of created an ‘offshorablity index’ of\\nour various service offerings. And we engage with -- we have started engaging with the\\ncustomers actively on why a certain piece of work must be done offshore and of course,\\nleveraging the whole hybrid working model that the COVID has taught us to see this work can\\nbe done from outside office, can be done anywhere. That whole engine between sales and\\ndelivery are starting to show results. We have been working on this for some time, and I expect\\nthis to continue.\\n\\nAkshay Ramnani:\\n\\nAnd second one was on headcount addition. This has been soft for past four quarters now. So\\nwould it be fair to say that our utilization, which came back to about 75% would have now\\nnormalized to the comfort range of 78% to 80%. And here on, we would need to add headcount\\ngoing forward. Is that the situation now?\\n\\nAmit Chadha:\\n\\nYes. So, number one, we did -- so number one was, yes, Q2 and Q3 saw us improving utilization,\\nrationalizing pyramid, etc. I do want to confirm that Q4 onwards, I do believe that headcount\\naddition sequentially will come back.\\nWe've reached levels that we are comfortable with because we are a tech company. We do invest\\nin labs, we invest in people working in labs, people creating solutions, practices, widgets, etc.\\nWe are comfortable with the utilization that we see now. And therefore, you will see headcount\\nincreasing now sequentially as we move forward quarterly.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe'll take the next question from the line of Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak Securities. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nKawaljeet Saluja:\\n\\nMy question is for Rajeev. Rajeev now when you are doing some back of the envelope\\ncalculation on margin guidance. And it seems that the way you have given guidance implies no\\ncontribution or a bit from the acquisition, SWC acquisition. Now is this largely because of\\n\\nPage 18 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Q3 FY23 Earnings Call\\nJanuary 19, 2023\\n\\namortization charge? Or do you expect the core organic margins also to deteriorate from that\\n18.5% you reported?\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nLet me clarify, this does not bake in any deterioration on the organic margin. I did mention it\\nearlier that given we've done 18.7% EBIT in Q3 with all the operational levers and improvement\\nin offshore and many of those things that we've talked about earlier, we do see a fair bit of\\ncomfort of sustaining this margin organically as we spoke.\\nAs far as the SWC acquisition, there is part of amortization also baked into it. Plus, there may\\nbe some investment that we would have to make. And as you would appreciate, the strategy that\\nAmit talked about in terms of Next-gen Communication, Sustainable Spaces and Cybersecurity,\\nwe will bring in experienced sales leaders to be based in respective geographies where we want\\nto drive growth, right, and be able to position this to the existing customers and also solicit newer\\ncustomers. So, part of that will be investments. But like I have said earlier that progressively,\\nwe should be able to see both revenue synergies and cost synergies play out.\\n\\nKawaljeet Saluja:\\n\\nSo, Rajeev, what would be the EBIT margin? Let say you given the EBITDA margin for SWC,\\n8% to 10%. What would the EBIT margin be? How much do you think it trends down to before\\nit starts recovering once the synergies kick in?\\n\\nRajeev Gupta:\\n\\nSo, Kawaljeet, I can answer to what is historical. Like I've said, we've been in an EBITDA range\\nof 8% to 10%. In terms of EBIT, very similar. I mean, there is not much of cost between EBITDA\\nand EBIT that that business entails. So that is where it is. To your specific question, I may have\\nsaid this in the previous call also, as we get more color, we will certainly provide that when we\\ncome back in Q1 FY24.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I would now like to hand the\\nconference over to Mr. Pinku Pappan for closing comments.\\n\\nPinku Pappan:\\n\\nThank you, everyone, for being present on the call today. And we hope we have answered most\\nof your questions. We'll be happy to connect with you during the course of the quarter to clarify\\nany other questions that may remain. With that, I would like to say bye and wish you all a very\\ngood day. Thank you.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you.

Good afternoon to all of you. Welcome to post results conference call of Prestige\\nGroup. We're happy to share that we had run the good quarter. If you look at the pre-sales\\nnumbers, have been little over INR 2,500 crores and the collections were at INR 2,300 crores.\\nWe had a few launches across resi and commercial projects.\\nMost importantly, we completed 11 million square-foot of projects during the quarter and 9\\nmonths as a whole, if you look at we have almost clocked the presale numbers, which are\\nequivalent to what we've done in FY '22 full year, that's happening. Very happy that the products\\nthat we've been launching across various geographies have met with a great response, given the\\nkind of deliveries that we have done in the last 5 years.\\nNine months as a whole, we have completed 14.5 million square foot launched across various\\nsegments, 21 million square foot of store project. And we'll be happy to inform you that the new\\nregion that we entered into last year in May 17, is the launch of the Prestige City at Mulund. So,\\nthe region of Mumbai has overall given in as of December 31, INR 1,652 crores of new sales.\\nAnd during the quarter, other highlight has been opening of the new mall, one of the largest\\nmalls in Bangalore, Forum Falcon City Mall. And with only half of the tenants opening, cinemas\\nnot yet open, but it had a great amount of footfall in that month, December itself. We had a little\\nover 1 million footfalls and the weekends' business had more than 100,000. And hospitality,\\nalso, as you see in our presentation, has clocked better ARR compared to the earlier quarters at\\nINR 12,800 on average.\\nCalicut is other region where we have launched a project. Again, the momentum has been good.\\nThe sales numbers are little over INR 200 crores coming from that region. If you have noticed,\\nwe have made a few changes to the presentation, given the kind of questions and the feedback\\nthat we were able to take from all of you.\\nThe launches have been split into residential and non-residential, so that we'll be able to track\\nbetter which is a residential, consumer development portfolio, and non-residential goes into\\n\\nPage 2 of 9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nFebruary 15, 2023\\nannuity portfolio. In addition to that, even for the launches of upcoming projects, we have given\\na large calendar. We have specified the financial year in which we expect to launch those projects\\ngiven the stage at which they are in currently.\\nLikewise, given completions, we are still, expect the date of completion of each project we have\\ngiven so that you would know when particular project revenue will come for recognition and at\\nthe same time with respect the capex project when will the uptick in annuity will happen. So\\ncompletion financial years also has been given.\\nWe also have given you the cash flows from the development business and nondevelopment\\nbusiness in third quarter and 9 months as well. So this is going to be the standard feature going\\nforward. Since all of you keep asking questions about balance to spend on the capex project,\\nnow we have included all the balances with respect to ongoing and upcoming projects for better\\nmonitoring and analysis by all of you as a slide.\\nAnd all of you must have received invitation for our analyst meet on 21st at Mumbai, at Prestige\\nCity, Mulund office. We look forward to seeing you there. The primary objective is that we want\\nto meet you in person. It's been long time since we met and also check out and discuss explain\\nto you the plan that we have in mind for the near term 3 years and the long-term 5 to 6 years\\nwith respect to each geography and each of the business segments that we are present in.\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nJust to add here, that January, we have clocked about INR 1,000-plus crores. So we cleared the\\nINR 10,000 crores what we did last year. So in 10 months, we finished what we did in a year.\\nOn the balance, February, March will give us that additional which will allow us to cross that\\nguidance of INR 12,000, maybe we'll do much more than that. Till then, it remains to be seen\\ndepending on the type of launches we get, that function of the approvals and the RERA approvals\\ncoming in and also, like Venkat rightly said, the presentation is that much more clear.\\nIt's easy to understand. And I think it can be much more than what has been given. Even the\\ncollections have been actually, we reached the collections what we normally do in a year in 9\\nmonths. So the next 3 months is additional collection that will happen, which will boost up the\\nentire collections of the full year.\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nAnd some of you have reached out to request about the change of area and upcoming projects.\\nJust to clarify before you ask questions, the land partner that we had at Begur, initially, we\\nwanted to do plotted development. Now we are doing residential township. Therefore, the total\\ndevelopment is 8 million square foot. That's a big change in the number.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nIn fact, that will be another number mover. Of course, the planning process has already\\ncommenced, and we are in the final stages of planning when it's all about approval, launch, and\\nthat area has been good to us. We, that's the same area where we did a project called Prestige\\nSong of the South, which is fully sold out. And I'm very, very sure that -- we've called this project\\nthe Southern Star -- Prestige Southern Star, and I'm sure it will be a star.\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nThank you. And with this, we can open the forum for question-and-answer, please.\\n\\nPage 3 of 9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nFebruary 15, 2023\\nModerator:\\n\\nFirst question comes from Parikshit Kandpal from HDFC Securities. The next question comes\\nfrom Pritesh Sheth from Motilal Oswal.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nThank you for the additional disclosures that you have provided, that's pretty helpful. First, on\\nthe launches. So quite a few launches lined up for Q4 or FY '23 around development. So if we\\ninclude the first phases of those projects because some of them are pretty large, what would be\\nthe area which we are expecting to launch? Should it, would it be like around 10 million, 12\\nmillion square feet is what your pipeline suggest? Or would it be that large? Or any comment on\\nthat?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nYes. I mean, this is the endeavour. These launches are totally 22.9 million square feet. We've\\nalso said which financial year '24, '23. That's also been written there. But for sure, what has\\nhappened with The Prestige City, Aston Park, we already have the approval. We're waiting for\\nRERA that will get launched this quarter. Serenity Shores, Lavender Fields, we're trying hard to\\nsee it to bring it to this quarter. That depends on the approval and the RERA number. That is\\nthese 3, Serenity Shores, Lavender Field and Park Grove. These are all pretty large. It's 9 million\\nplus 3.12, plus 1.5 million 13.5 million.\\nI believe that if we do get the RERA number, say, by middle of March, we should be able to get\\nsome of the revenue in this quarter. If it doesn't happen, then the entire revenue will come and\\nkick in for the next quarter. But then this is in the pipeline because it's already one stage of\\napproval is done. It's only the BBMP approval that needs to come and the RERA.\\nSo government works at its own speed, and we don't have control on that. But whenever that\\nhappens, it's definitely going to be a number mover. ELM Park has already been launched, met\\nwith a good response, but it's a pretty small project. It's only 0.5 million square feet in Bangalore.\\nSo also, Park Ridge is again under approval and Southern Star and all these others are all FY\\n'24.\\nMumbai, Chennai, yes, another target again it's FY '24. It won't happen in this quarter for, sure.\\nAnd we also Noida has been like an evasive approval for us. And we are trying all our efforts to\\nseek that approval comes. The CEC is ready. We are all set to launch it. But again, it depends\\non when the approval comes. Hopefully, we should be able to do it in the first quarter of next\\nyear. And also Hyderabad, we've got some very large ones.\\nThe Clairmont has already been launched met with a fantastic response. And the Prestige City\\nHyderabad, we should catch this quarter, maybe in March, middle of March and there's a lot of\\nalready vibrancy on that, our team is getting ready for it. And Rock Cliff will go through\\nfinancial year '24. That again is the process of approval. That's where we are.\\nAnd Mumbai, yes, whatever is there. Jijamata Nagar in FY '25 with all the things. And then\\nOcean Tower, the Nautilus, it will again happen and of course, Ocean Tower, we're trying to\\nbring it in March. But Ocean Tower, Nautilus, it doesn't happen March it will go into April. But\\nthese 2 also are almost steady. Prestige City Mulund has already been launched. So there's\\nnothing for us to say. It's but there are a lot of components to it.\\n\\nPage 4 of 9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nFebruary 15, 2023\\nWe, now the Bellanza Towers and Siesta Towers have been launched. Forest Hill will go into\\nFY '25. That is why we put that at 4.37 million square feet, which is to be launched in FY '25.\\nSo also, these are another, which is FY '25.\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nAnd in terms of the cash flow disclosures that we have added this quarter, I don't see interest\\ncost line item. Obviously, it's the financing part. Is it included in the construction cost or\\noverheads above? Or that is additional to whatever costs which we have discussed?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nNow as far as residential business is concerned, whatever actually now with all these launches,\\nwe will be cash flow positive fully throughout. Actually, there will be a lot of money that will\\nbe coming in. Where the cash flow will be required, again, I said just this morning also, there\\nare a lot of capex projects which we are planning both in hospitality, office as well as in retail.\\nNow this will be a mixture of internal accruals through positive cash flow from regular\\n\\nthe\\n\\nresidential business, plus also a combination of debt. So we plan to have a 60-40, 60% our own\\nmoney, 40% debt.\\nAmit:\\n\\nJust on the real cash flow business, we have just given the major hedges and not the entire cash\\nflow statement, okay? We have given what is the operational cash flow and major hedges of\\ninvesting cash flow. As regards financing cash flow, that is debt drawn and interest payment that\\nis not included in the P&L.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nOkay. And how much of that would be interest cash flow, if you have it handy?\\n\\nAmit:\\n\\nIt would be close to INR 550 crores.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nINR 550 crores. And that's for 9 months?\\n\\nAmit:\\n\\nThat's for 9 months, yes.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nAnd just lastly, while you highlighted about Begur area has been increased. Any specific reason\\nfor also Hyderabad, the Prestige City. Then also, I can see the increase in area, and why not\\nshare economic interest in that project has reduced? So if you can just explain that a bit.\\n\\nAmit:\\n\\nIn Hyderabad, in the earlier presentation, we had included the Prestige entity share, Okay? There\\nwas a landowner also, that the 50% of landowner is not included. In the current presentation, we\\nhave made that change.\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nAnd it's going to be holistic development, combining landowner area and our area. Total area\\ngrowth of fund economic, intent comes up.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nAnd then, of course, whatever we do with the landowner, we get paid as a P&C from the\\nlandowner. So that's also additional revenue to the company.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question comes from Yash Gupta from Thinksight Advisory.\\n\\nYash Gupta:\\n\\nTotal launch in Mulund as of now is around to be 3.7 million square feet and Daffodils we have\\nlaunched 0.15 million square feet. And total sales for this 9 months around to be like INR 1,662\\n\\nPage 5 of 9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And\\nwhat EBITDA margin we are keeping in mind for the Mumbai projects?\\nVenkat:\\n\\nSo I mean, the EBITDA margins for each of the projects vary. Beverly Hills -- Daffodils\\ndefinitely high EBITDA margin. Whereas Prestige City Mulund will be a normal EBITDA\\nmargin at which we operate in between 30% and 35%. The exact breakup between these 2\\nprojects, we don't -- yes, we don't -- there will -- for the quarter. For Q3, sales, not the entire 9\\nmonths, if we have a breakup year, Prestige City Mulund contributed INR 362 crores.\\n\\nYash Gupta:\\n\\nINR 362 crores from Mulund. And what about Daffodils?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nDaffodils, INR 100 crores would be the Daffodils.\\n\\nYash Gupta:\\n\\nSorry, please, amount, sir?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nINR 100 crores.\\n\\nYash Gupta:\\n\\nINR 100-odd crores. Okay. And second question, what are the challenges that you may face in\\nthe execution of the construction in Mumbai? Last -- in next 2 to 3 that we're going to construct\\na lot of construction in Mumbai. So, what are the challenges you may face in the Mumbai\\nmarket?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nWe build the organization on the backdrop of execution excellence. Last five years, in spite of\\nthe issues, challenges that industry has gone through in terms of bringing in new registrations,\\nfinancial crisis, NBFC-related issues, COVID-related, in spite of all that, last 5.5 years are\\ndelivering 781 million square foot.\\nAnd we work with reputed contractors. We are very choosy with who we want to work with.\\nWe have a set team there. In fact, I don't know whether any of you had a chance to visit Prestige\\nCity Mulund or near Byculla. The construction is in full swing and Prestige Jasdan Classic is\\nalmost ahead of schedule in terms of construction progress. And you will experience the scale\\nof construction at Mulund when we're done with construction. So as of now, we are not facing\\nany challenges for this.\\nBoth these projects are has been contracted, and then it will be works with us on various projects\\nin Bangalore as well. We have that very strong and deep relationship with them as of same like\\nthe way we've been doing it in other cities, including Bangalore.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question comes from Kunal Lakhan from CLSA.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nOn -- firstly, on the segment-wise results, when I look at the residential numbers, especially\\nEBITDA, it's at about 18%, and it was about 18% in FY '22 as well. Is that where we should see\\nthis on a steady-state basis going ahead? Or do you think this will improve? And what will be\\nthe levers for improvement, if at all?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nNo, I think it's a combination of what has come for revenue recognition. And you should see\\nuptick in residential EBITDA margin. The stabilized margin should be around 25%.\\n\\nPage 6 of 9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nFebruary 15, 2023\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nOkay. So it's been a project mix in the 9 months as well as FY '22?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nOkay, okay. Sure. My second question was on the rental projections that you have given. Firstly,\\nthanks for sharing the breakup of the balance capex and so on and so forth. But when I look at\\nthe rental portfolio scale up, right, in terms of annuity income, is it fair to assume that this rental\\nbuild-up does not or would not include any of the upcoming projects? Because I'm assuming\\nyou'll start to work on the upcoming projects and they are not yet completed at least in the next\\n4 to 5 years. So is it fair to assume that this does not include upcoming portfolio, both in\\ncommercial as well as retail and it's purely ongoing?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nNo, it does include. It does include, and most of the upcoming projects that you see in the\\nschedule will get launched maximum of 12 to 18 months' time from now. And it's not that there\\nis too much of a lack from now on to launch those projects. So they are included in that. And\\nincrementally, ongoing projects will get completed and upcoming projects will get launched.\\nThat's why we're doing step up. And for you to understand better, we will also in completion\\ndates also -- in upcoming...\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nSure, sure. So essentially, what we are seeing is basically we plan to spend about INR 15,000\\ncrores incrementally. And towards that, we'll get about INR 2,500 crores plus about INR 500\\ncrores odd in retail. So about INR 3,000 crores of rental from this kind of a spend once it reaches\\nsteady state. Is that the right assumption?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nBetween office and retail, yes. So next 5 years that goes up to FY '28.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nSure, sure. That's helpful. And lastly, on the some of the data keeping questions on the project\\nside. If I look at the area in Ocean Towers has gone up from 0.8 million square feet to 1.68\\nmillion square feet and also the stake has gone from 30% to 60%. Any reason behind that?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nOne is the total development. So what we have given is indicating, one, once development plan\\ngot frozen, the exact area we have captured here, total developable area, also because we are\\nproviding some public parking there. And the second is the J V Partner as moved up now it's\\ngoing to be fully ourselves.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nWe're going to buy that land.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nOkay. So but that stake still shows at 60%. So will it go up farther?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nAnd lastly, a similar question on Mulund also. Like Mulund, last quarter, we saw the total\\nsaleable area between like launched and upcoming was about 11 million square feet. And this\\nquarter, it's lower at about 9 million square feet. So 2 million square feet has reduced in Mulund\\nnow. Is that correct?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nWe are looking at it give us a moment, Kunal.\\n\\nPage 7 of 9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nFebruary 15, 2023\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question comes from Parikshit Kandpal from HDFC Securities.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nMy first question is on the Mumbai sales, MMR sales, so we have a target of about INR 3,000\\ncrores of annual sales. So do you think you'll be able to make it in the fourth quarter?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nMumbai, see, we've already done up to today, that is -- as of 9 months, it was INR 1,700 crores.\\nI think this quarter, I should be able to do another INR 1,000 crores. So that's where we are as\\nof now.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nAlmost reached that.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nAnd my second question is on the business development pipeline in MMR. So now is quite\\nsizable in terms of contribution to prefigure. So now we have -- beyond Mulund, I think major\\nlaunches now in Mulund will be only in FY '25 for the rest of development inventory. So how\\ndo you how is the business development shaping up in MMR now on the existing projects you\\nhave already shooted?\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nWe have 3, 4 projects that needs to be launched.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nThat is Central Mumbai. He's talking about MMR.\\n\\nVenkat:\\n\\nSo now while we are evaluating projects in MMR region, we want to focus and go to the next\\nstep after launching because we deploy a lot of capital in Ocean Towers and then focus on MMR\\nregion. We are evaluating a couple of projects in that region. Maybe Q1 will have more concrete\\ninformation.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nI mean, Mulund has been our star project where we have seen both volume and velocity, while\\nother projects like Jasdan, we have not seen a similar kind of a success. So you maybe your\\nstrategy was to do it more closer to the completion or maybe higher construction. So how will\\nbe the strategy going ahead for all these new launches in MMR, which will be high ticket or will\\nbe positioned as premium, it’s both Nautilus or Ocean or even Jasdan. So for next year, the\\ncurrent pipeline, how do you think could be potentially the presales, given that this year we were\\nclose to about INR 2,700 crores?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nYes. I mean, I'm very, very hopeful that both Marine, that is our Ocean Tower as well as Nautilus\\nthey are two different geographies. One is Worli, one is Marine Drive. I think these are very\\ndifferent, very good locations. And they should do extremely well. I think we already have some\\nsort of a vibrancy that we feel there's a traction. And I think moment we get the approvals and\\nget our act together in terms of our selling equipment, we should be able to sell that pretty well.\\nI mean, there is a lot of pent-up demand there.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nOkay. Just the last question on the BKC commercial tower. So it's still showing in the upcoming.\\nSo why have these projects do not move into the ongoing projects. So if you can update us on\\nthe status of approvals or construction? Has it started? Or any update on that will be helpful. .\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nBKC, we've already started filing for the entire there's a BKC X and a Y, both we started filing.\\nAlso, we started filing for the rehab tower.

Handing it over to them for the initial comments. Mr. Razack, over to\\nyou.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nThank you. I think I will ask Venkat to give the opening remarks. Yes, there's a lot has happened\\nduring the quarter and I think it's a financial year-end also. So the numbers are all there for\\neveryone to see. And whatever we set out to do during the financial year, it gives me satisfaction\\nto say we've over-exceeded our target. And hopefully, we'll keep doing that. We'll keep\\nexceeding everybody's expectations. And that's our job because the whole team is on the ball,\\nand they definitely want to keep performing, and that is what is keeping us going.\\nWith this, of course, all of you will be quite curious to know about yesterday's news, the\\nacquisition of the 50% stake in DB Realty in both the office assets, but that's also, I believe, is a\\nstrategic move, which will help us to do our job easily. And also, it's I think it's a win-win for\\nboth parties I think more about it Venkat will tell you. And I will just ask Venkat to give us the\\nopening remarks.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThank you, sir. Thank you, everyone, for taking out time to be on this call. And very happy to\\ntake you through the operational and financial performance of the company for the FY '23. It's\\nbeen once again, a remarkable year for us, we did cross a milestone number of INR10,000 crores\\nlast year as you are aware. And some of you did ask questions saying that, okay, now that you\\nreach that magical number, how will you sustain and how we grow on that number and what\\nwill be the strategy?\\nAnd we did give out a strategy last year itself saying that, the new geography will contribute to\\nthe growth. And rightly so, Mumbai registered little over INR2,700 crores of sales that helped.\\nBetween Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad majority of the case for this year outcome. Also\\nimportant thing that I wanted to take a note of is 60% of our sales have come from Bangalore\\nand 40% all other branch offices have contributed.\\nI think going forward, there will be further increased contribution from regions of Mumbai with\\nthe new launches that are coming up. There are 2 new launches that are 3 in fact next phase age\\nof Prestige City Mulund, Prestige Ocean Towers at Marine Lines and Prestige Nautilus at Worli,\\n3 new projects lined up. So Mumbai should give better numbers this year. Hyderabad, we have\\n\\nPage 2 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nMay 31, 2023\\nagain Prestige City as we told earlier in the call, Prestige City as a brand is something which\\nwe're going to launch in all the cities that we are operational one after the other. This will be\\nanchor development for that particular city, and these are large in size and midfield\\ndevelopments.\\nPrestige City at Hyderabad will get launched soon. Therefore, contribution from Hyderabad,\\nMumbai and Chennai will have, this year we didn't have sizable launch in the last couple of\\nyears. We'll have a large projects getting launched. Prestige Pallava Gardens, which is over 2.5\\nmillion square foot, even chennai will start contributing this year. Overall, in spite of talking\\n25% growth number and closing the year close to INR13,000 crores of retail next year is even\\nmore exciting to the kind of launch pipeline that we have.\\nAnd the other important aspect is collection. Some of you earlier used to ask questions, when\\nyou look at the sales and you've seen some of the developers, you compare and ask even the\\nbulk bookings, etcetera and all that. So to put everything to that you'll see the collection there,\\nalmost commensurate with the sales that we are doing. So at least our collection printed from,\\nthey're collecting all outstanding. They are not much.\\nAnd they are INR10,000 crores, INR9,185 crores, INR10,000 crores of collections from\\nresidential projects, up by 31% year-on-year. This quarter, we have seen higher ever collection\\nmade in any quarter. Derivation so have gone up. And among the other things, we had I think\\nafter the end of financial year we had a new boutique resort that has opened up, this is Mulberry\\nShades at Nandi Hills, both are together with Marriott.\\nYou all know that JW Marriott, our Golfshire has become landmark project. It’s address maker\\nand most of now even that are happening in Bangalore are, outside people coming and having\\nwith a destination wedding and destination event. I'm very happy with the kind of response that\\nthe hotel has received. And in addition to the hotel property, we launched Forum mall at Prestige\\nFalcon City, which met with great success.\\nAnd in fact, weekends we're seeing a phenomenal amount of crowd, people visiting while in\\nspite of cinemas not yet being operational. We also had top launch, and we have handed over\\nthe property Forum at Kochi, which is, again, a large mall. So these 2 will be operational. And\\nlast year, we also opened Forum Rex, which is a boutique, high end mall. Which had cinemas,\\nwhich are exclusive in the form of director's cut.\\nSo malls are back, quarters are doing well. Office space leasing has been good. We're happy to\\ntell you that whatever the buildings that we have been constructing at Pune. It's been completely\\nleased out, close to 1 million square foot at Kharadi. And various other buildings in Bangalore.\\nThe leasing is ongoing, and it's been good. So we have in Hyderabad, projects getting completed.\\nAnd a few others in Bangalore, we are very confident that we'll be preferred, obviously, as\\nsupplier but most of the MNC companies given a relationship, given the quality of the building\\nand given the specification. And the residential is what we have spoken about.\\n\\nPage 3 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nMay 31, 2023\\nAnd most important, as chairman mentioned in opening remarks, is the strategic acquisition that\\nwe have done. And before we, I get into the financial performance of the company, maybe I'll\\nspend a couple of minutes explaining to you what is even, what have we done.\\nInitially, when we got into the transaction, a project at BKC and projects at Worli, both\\ncommercial products. There was issues on ground. There were other shareholders in the SPV,\\nso let me talk about BKC, there was a ILFS as a shareholder, there was Treaty German fund as\\na shareholder. And this was in a way a NCLT. There was tenants on the ground who need to be\\nvacated. Of course, there was no planning, there is no approval.\\nNow from then to now, it's a completely cleaned up site, most of you must be visiting these\\nareas, signages are done, work has started, visits are approved and approvals have come, the\\nother shareholders have been acquitted completely cleaned up and work started approvals are in\\nplace. Now we thought to give a boost to our annuity portfolio since our JV partner wanted to\\nbe like in debt, and he had other challenges to address and deal with in terms of the obligations,\\netcetera, and an opportunity came by to acquire the stake and become 100% owner in both their\\nseries, we thought it is given the fact that the project work has started and it's only construction\\nthat we need to do and which we have been executing and delivering.\\nYou all know last 5.5 years, we have delivered 90 million square foot, that's our forte, given the\\nthemes that we have. Therefore, it's a strategic acquisition, it'll help and grow annuity portfolio\\nfaster and these are marquee assets. We did a valuation and acquired the stake in both the SPVs\\nby paying out INR980 odd crores here and INR198 crores in Turf Estates LLP.\\nAnd the with kind of buildings that we're making there, and we definitely see that the rentals\\nwill be definitely higher than what we have presumed for valuation currently. And also the cap\\nrate compression will happen. Right now, we look at 9.5% of cap rate on the time of valuation.\\nSo I think by the time building is ready, the cap rate can be 8%, maybe less than that but it still\\nwill give substantial valuation upside.\\nWe looked at rentals around 275, 300 levels. We firmly believe that rentals could be between\\n325 to 350. So rental upside cap rate compression both together,both the projects put together,\\nwill have the valuation upside of almost INR3,500 odd crores. But therefore, we find it good\\nacquisition and we went ahead and completed the transaction. I'm sure you will also appreciate\\nthe reasons behind the transaction. Of course, in the Q&A, if you have any issue, any further\\ninformation that you want, we will definitely discuss.\\nMoving ahead, we had a remarkable amount of launches this year. I don't think the developers\\nthat have launched in a year 27 million square foot. So that's what we have launched last year.\\n70 million square foot comes from our residential and 10 million square foot comes from capex\\nis up 57% compared to last year. Even completions were very good. We completed 16 million\\nsquare foot of area last year, a majority of being residential.\\nAnd on average, including holiday, Sundays, weekends and all that. We had a good run last year,\\nsold close to 26 units a day, aggregating to 9,644 units overall. The segment that has sold well\\n\\nPage 4 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nMay 31, 2023\\nand contributed significantly is a segment of INR80 lakhs to INR1.5 crores bracket, that value,\\naffordable/mid-income segment.\\nAnd moving on to the financial performance of the company. We had, yes, we had overall\\nrevenue of INR8,772 crores, up 33% compared to last year and EBITDA of INR2,543 crores\\nand PAT at INR2,000 crores at 11%, this is for the year. And for the quarter, we had a higher\\nPAT on an exceptional item being coming from the accounting.\\nSo we also have given out segment results as you can see and what is the economy equity and\\nwritten on capital employ that we are making between office, retail, hospitality, services and the\\nresidential. Retail just because mall -- one of our large malls got completed just closer to the end\\nof fiscal, and it has not run a full year. So you see the returns being lower. We'll analyse them\\nprobably in quarter end and residential are high. Office contributed ROE of close to 50%, retail\\nat 40%, hospitality at 10%, services, of course, there's no investment so higher, residential at\\n35%.\\nAnd overall, the capital employed has been earning well for us. With this brief, we would like\\nto open the forum for question and answers.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe first question comes from the line of Parikshit Kandpal from HDFC Securities.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nCongratulations Irfan ji and Venkat for this deal. My first question is on the total payout is\\nINR1,176 crores for both the deal. So can you break it up like because we have already given\\nsome advantages on behalf like of the partner in terms of getting approvals and all. So what will\\nbe the actual cash outflow out of this INR1,176 crores?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nAll that has been taken into consideration, our net payout is what we have indicated.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nSo INR1,176 crores is the cash payout. And what would be the overall commitments you would\\nhave done like in terms of earlier on behalf of partner?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nSo there are 2 ways of listening in, if you consider them as 50% partners. Now we'll have to\\nhave spent in addition to the payers that they have -- we have made to them. 50% of the\\nconstruction cost on premium.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nSo the understanding was that construction costs would be incurred by us anyways, and only the\\napproval costs and clearing up costs...\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nNow let me take you through that mechanism. So let's look at BKC. So construction costs and\\nthe money that we have spent to buy out the earlier shareholder both put together. Earlier 50%\\nhad come to us at INR2,250 crores kind of valuation earlier. Entire construction cost of\\nINR2,000 crores being borne by us and the money that we have invested to buy us. So that was\\nearlier 50%.\\nNow if you look at the entire premium money will be borne by us. And also, there is a cash out\\nthat we need to give. All put together, and earlier premium also clarified also together, this\\nobligation, including the cash payout is going to be at around INR2,200 crores.\\n\\nPage 5 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nMay 31, 2023\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nBasically, monthly and all time effectively at INR2,200 crores of 50% stake indication.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nYes. I said there's no much difference between earlier and now.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nOkay. And what about the Mahalaxmi one because as I look at the valuation, so we can see only\\ncomes at INR1,956 crores and the Mahalaxmi at INR400 crores. I just look at 50% buyout. That\\nwas the reason I was telling to like what's the potential.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nIt's higher because it's a taller building. And rental, we have factored in at least INR25 difference\\nin terms of both -- almost areas are same, taller building construction cost is a little higher and\\nthe rentals we have taken INR25 lesser. So therefore, the valuations are different.\\nThere, again, I mean, if you look at the numbers, we have paid INR198 crores and the premium\\nof INR1,400 crores and the LUC of INR200 crores. And we have cost for INR150 crores. This\\nis what we'll assume especially that will come to around in INR1,800 to INR2,000 crores that\\nnumber.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nOkay. So similar kind of a number there also. So almost INR2,200 year and...\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nWe have paid by 50% was also entire construction cost was up and half of the head up. That\\nmakes it around INR2,350 crores to INR2,400 crores. So what we had got earlier versus now\\nare almost same, primarily because, as you mentioned, whatever the outflow was there with\\nrespect to earlier premium payment also as you are aware, we only have paid. And therefore,\\nnot much change in the numbers then and now.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nMy second question is now on these 2 assets, you have most significant 100% kind of stake. So\\nany plans of like monetization of this thing going ahead because these 2 are very significant\\nassets and give rent upwards of INR100 crores annually. Any thoughts there? How do you, I\\nunderstand that you were earlier looking at financing 50-50 that equity. So how do you, with\\nthis change happening and now being a Prestige project. So how the outlook will change towards\\nthe financial closure of these assets, execution of this asset, leasing and even monetization. Any\\nthoughts there?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nI mean this prior to doing the Blackstone transaction, we did look at monetizing those assets by\\ngoing to the REIT combining retail as well as office, probably would have done first hybrid\\nreach in the country. Right now, when we're acquiring, we're not thinking of divesting, first and\\nforemost step is to increase the pace of construction and ensure that buildings come up faster\\nand are visible. And for which we'll see there is always that premiums for completed building\\nand higher premium for new building. So we'll play accordingly. Right now, there's, I think, the\\nstrategic dilution talks that are happening.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nBoth these projects are financially closed now? I mean the loan has been tied up and the work\\nhas started at both this point.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nFor anyone to see financial closures are done. So therefore, that's what I said, the next 36 months,\\nwe would want to, you know walk within complete BKC and maybe 40, 42 months tops.\\n\\nPage 6 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nMay 31, 2023\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nAnd just the last question on residential business in Bangalore, we have seen a decline in Y-oY for the full year FY '22 to '23, while other markets have contributed to the growth as the\\nMumbai. But how do you see Bengaluru market now in FY '24?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nIt's not a decline because there was no demand, it's a decline because we didn’t have inventory,\\nbecause goods delayed. And there's a lot of inventory that's going and coming from the\\nBangalore market. Recently, we did a launch call Prestige Lavender Fields, that's again in\\nWhitefield, 1,400 units, I think about 4 million square feet, funding 3 million or 4 million aspect\\nand profiting 3 million. But the entire thing is sold.\\nSo that's the type of demand we have. Unfortunately, we didn't have inventory. In fact, in\\nMangalore, even ready inventory because there are only 2 geographies where we have ready\\ninventory is Bangalore and Hyderabad. And Hyderabad is also like new. Bangalore is also as\\ngood as new. And the thing is we are working really, really hard pressurizing to see that we get\\nthe approval filed for RERA, get the RERA number and launch. I think what Venkat said is, we\\ndid a lot of launches. But then in other cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad.\\nBangalore was soft on launches. Hopefully, this year, this quarter, we did Prestige Lavender\\nFields in the next 2 to 3 quarters, we'll be getting a host of other launches because there's a huge\\nvisibility of getting these approvals soon. It's all a function of the inventory that's available. In\\nfact, I would say, if we had really launched what we were planning to, we would have cross in\\nthis fiscal itself, that is the last '23 cross 15, but unfortunately, we couldn't do that, and that\\ndifferential would have come from backlog.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nThat's the target this year? Like in FY '23, you're looking to what the thesis guidance?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nNo, I believe we can easily safely look at a 25%.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nNext question comes from the line of Pritesh Sheth from Motilal Oswal Financial Services\\nLimited.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nCongrats on the great year. Firstly, just a few clarifications on this DB again, foundation again.\\nSo one is, does it change our capex outlay from here on? I mean, which is INR15,000 crores. So\\nas you said, we were earlier 50% partner with capex, that 50%, should I presume that we are\\npaying it upfront with buying out this stake?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nNo, not really. So in fact, the clarification that was said earlier also. As for the JV understanding,\\nthe construction costs were to be borne by us. All the premium LUC and portion of free halfrelated costs to be borne by the partner. Now construction cost, whatever we were -- anyway\\nearlier was to incur is over a period of time, linked to progress.\\nEven the payments we have on LUC are also staggered for a period of time. In fact, the\\ntransaction is -- come at a time, which is for the builder annuity portfolio. Even from a partner\\npoint of view, if that stake invested, they are to bring a lot of money for the premium and we\\nhad for construction and like LUC payment and all of that. As against, bringing in money, they\\nare actually taking out lots of INR1,200 crores. It will help their cash flow.\\n\\nPage 7 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nMay 31, 2023\\nWhen you are structuring the deal because this land were held by them for quite some time,\\nthey're a little attach to the land. So we did mention saying that given the situation it is usually\\nbeneficial, once the projects are ready and if we have money at some point in time. Fine, we can\\nbuy the area, they're looking at selling, we are evaluating selling to somebody else, and we have\\nbeen a partner before at that point in time prevailing, you can buy the area, that's how we\\nstructured the deal. I think we've got a great potential and value upside and it's a win-win\\nproposition..\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nNo doubt about it. But just trying to assess what would be the additional pay-outs apart from this\\nINR1,176 crores from our side?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nAny other payments except for the premiums which they have to pay. Now the other thing is\\nnow Venkat said, emotional this and that, but ultimately I think knowing them and knowing their\\nmind, they will take this money and come back to us and give us the space, that we've already\\njust sort of..\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nSorry, I think line is not clear. Your voice is cracking.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nNo, I was mentioning when we're structuring the deal. It is, of course, win-win because we want\\nto consolidate and they have a requirement for money to fulfil the data obligation, so it helps.\\nBut during the transaction discussion came out, they somehow want to have some areas.\\nSo in the conversations we did mention saying once the project is complete, we have the cash\\nflows at that point in time, what is the prevailing market price, you are free to buy the area. So I\\nmean, if you're looking at divesting to anybody else, why not you, that's how we have mentioned,\\nthat's what came rate.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nAnd how much would be the additional premium payment now that would be required?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nI just gave out the numbers, right, INR1,200 crores. And yes, overall, including what we have\\nalready paid. Overall premiums are INR1,500 crores and rehab and LUC charges are another\\nINR350 crores. So the total in addition to what we have paid is going to be close to INR1,800\\nto INR1,900 crores.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nAnd Plus INR1,176 crores additional that we have to buy..\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nOf that we have already incurred close to INR1,000 crores because we avail that 50% scheme\\nand paid the premium.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nOkay. So balance there is INR800 crores and then INR1,176 crores additional for buying out the\\nstate.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. Whatever you said, that's correct.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nOkay. Perfect. And just last on, I'm just trying to reconcile the net debt increase for the quarter,\\nwhich increased by INR1,400 crores quarter-on-quarter. While the cash flow that you have given\\nindicate that the net deficit was around INR400 crores since we generated OCF of INR1,500\\n\\nPage 8 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nMay 31, 2023\\ncrores and spend INR1,900 for investment. Some of it is obviously with regards to the interest\\noutflow. But can you help me reconcile the balance part of it?\\nAmit Mor:\\n\\nYou want me to run you through the...\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nSee, increase the net debt, primarily, there's a lot of payout towards the transaction.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nSo we have already paid it and that's reflected in net debt, is it?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nSo earlier premiums are also funded by us, and some of these considerations have already been\\npaid, most of actually, this money that we are talking about has been paid. I'm just getting for\\ncash flow. So if you look at over our 12 months cash flow, INR11,000 crores of inflow on that\\nconstruction costs, we have spent INR4,252 crores and landowner payments, sales, marketing,\\nthat mean everything put together INR2,700 crores. That's totalling to INR7,000 crores, and we\\nhave cash flow of INR4,000 crores.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nYes, that's INR4,000. Now what is the exact query?\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nI was just talking about the quarter. So I mean, for the quarter, I can see INR1,500 crores of\\noperating cash flow, INR1,900 crores of spend, so INR400 crores of deficit but net debt has\\nincreased by INR1,200 crores, INR1,400 crores quarter-on-quarter. So I was just trying to\\nreconcile whether it's because of any and there would be obviously payments outside of what\\nwe have given in cash flows. So what are those?\\n\\nAmit Mor:\\n\\nPritesh, we have made some partner pay-out, the minority interest in certain SPVs. We have\\nmade payments to them. That was around in the team of around INR300 crores. Apart from that,\\nthe cash balance also is reduced. So what we have given in cash flow is really the operational\\nand investment activities. The financing portion, we have not given in that the payments to\\npartners and all that is captured. That has resulted in an increase in net debt.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nNext time we will add that also and give it to you. It will be holistic.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nSure. And if you can also add interest outflows to the cash flow, so that would be very easy for\\nus too.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nUnder financing activities, the amount we bring in that head automatically you will get it. That\\nour developmental business is cash flow positive. That was objective, now we'll also anyway\\ngive you comprehensive.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nSure. Thank you\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nNext question comes from the line of Murtuza Arsiwalla from Kotak Securities.\\n\\nMurtuza Arsiwalla:\\n\\nSorry, I just want to delve a little more into the acquisition itself. So on a gross basis, the 5\\nmillion-odd square feet would have INR2,000 crores of rentals. You said the premium was about\\nINR1,500 crores, rehab cost is about INR350 crores. Can you give us specifically the\\nconstruction cost for this? And out of all of the cost, how much have already been spent? And\\nis there any debt on these 2 entities just yet?\\n\\nPage 9 of 12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

And then you are adding up everything, then you should add up the rehab construction\\nthat we have to do, which is at INR350 crores. And premiums I mentioned to you, saying that\\naround overall you have to pay and balance to be paid, all together will be in the range of\\nINR1,018 odd crores. And there is LUC charges of INR300-odd crores. And we also considered\\nsome interest some more in the digit.\\n\\nMurtuza Arsiwalla:\\n\\nAnd how much has been spent. So I'm getting an aggregation of roughly about INR7,000 crores.\\nHow much against the INR7,000 crores is already spent?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nWith lower INR500 crores towards construction costs.\\n\\nMurtuza Arsiwalla:\\n\\nAnd is there any debt?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nNo. External rate, right, not intercompany rate.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Biplab Debbarma from Antique Stockbroking Limited.\\n\\nBiplab Debbarma:\\n\\nCongratulations for the excellent FY '23.

What is the status of that project and the structure remains the same in that project?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nSo these are 2 different companies. The projects are next to each other; therefore, we call it as\\none single name 101 but they are differentiated by X and Y, nomenclature Y. The shareholding\\npattern is completely different.

Hello Samar I think I will hand it over to Venkat to just\\nsummarize what has happened during the quarter and then I am available for any\\nquestions.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThank you Sir. Thanks Samar and good afternoon to all of you. We have had exceptional\\nquarter. We had a great beginning for the fiscal FY2024. The total sales for the quarter\\nstood at 3915 Crores up 30% year-on-year. Collections were at 2741 Crores up 28%.\\nThere is significant growth in average realization per square foot up by 20% there at\\n10,244 when it comes to apartments and over 5000 when it comes to plots. We have sold\\n2276 units this quarter at around run rate of 760 homes per month being sold aggregating\\nto 3.8 million square feet area. Q1 this fiscal we had one launch, the launch plan for the\\nfiscal is huge. We had one launch in the form of the Prestige Lavender Fields, which was\\ninstant sellout and there was a great response and significant amount of contributions for\\nthis quarter sales have come from that project. Mumbai continues to contribute at a good\\nrun rate. We had 600 Crores of sales from Mumbai coming in, 450 Crores of sales have\\ncome from Prestige city at Mulund and balance come between Prestige Jasdan Classic at\\nMahalaxmi and Prestige Daffodils at Pali Hill.\\nIn terms of completion and launches, we had overall 3.11 million square feet of launches\\nthat is one launch Prestige Lavender Fields and we have a completion of 5.9 million\\nsquare foot spread across four projects Prestige Great Acres at The Prestige City, Prestige\\nMarigold plotted development project, Prestige Elysian Bengaluru at Bannerghatta Road\\nand Prestige Mulberry Shades a hospitality project and the launch pipeline for the rest of\\nthe year very robust. We have large projects coming up for launch in the form of Prestige\\n\\nPage 2 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\nPark Grove in Bengaluru, The Prestige city at Hyderabad, Prestige Pallava Gardens at\\nChennai, Prestige Bougainvillea Gardens at Noida which is going to be our maiden launch,\\nfirst project launch at the NCR region. We are exciting. We are looking forward for the rest\\nof the year in these launches and with this I think we will continue with the same\\nmomentum maybe better than what we have done in this quarter.\\nMoving on to financial highlights, this quarter had a little dip in overall revenue\\nrecognition. This is linked as all you know to the completion of the project. We do not\\nhave much of a complete inventory so the instant recognition of revenue by way of\\nselling of a complete inventory is not there any longer so whenever we sell the inventory\\nwhich is just launched or ongoing so they come for recognition only when the project\\ngets completed so therefore we had only 1966 Crores of revenue coming as a financial\\nturnover. Total EBITDA stood at 812, PAT at 317, the percentages that you see are\\ndriven by exceptional items which is with respect to REIT units that we hold on a retail\\nportfolio when we sold our malls to Blackstone we continue to the hold 15% of those\\nmalls and we converted that into units and we also invested a little extra money and hold\\naround 4.5% of the overall REIT because we did mark-to-market of those units from\\noriginal costs to where they are currently getting traded there is exceptional item that got\\nrecognized which contributed to the extent of 240 Crores to EBITDA and 210 Crores to\\nPAT, so therefore you see EBITDA number at 41% compared to 16%. Leaving aside in\\ngeneral because the fixed expenditure is almost same quarter-on-quarter irrespective of\\n3000 Crores or 4000 Crores of topline or 1966 Crores the way we have done this quarter\\nthat continues to be same therefore you will see a slight dip in the profit margin even\\nafter removing exceptional items because there are some queries that has come in this\\nregard, therefore I am making use of this opportunity at the opening remarks itself to\\nclarify to all of you.\\nNow moving on to the construction spend in cash flows, the overall construction spend\\nfor this quarter has been at 1790 Crores split between various segments of our business,\\nresidential and commercial which are development business, residential primarily we\\nhave spent around 1200 Crores, commercial office space projects we spent 350 Crores,\\nretail we have spent 75 Crores and hospitality around 165 Crores. This has been overall\\nspend and there is a lot of money that we have invested towards the new land acquisitions\\nand stake wise that is almost 1300 Crores during the quarter, but if you look at\\noperationally we had 2716 Crores of collection from the development business and we\\nspent 1182 Crores on construction of developmental business and after subtracting the\\nlandowner payment, sales and marketing expenses, employee, administration and\\n\\nPage 3 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\neverything we had operationally very positive net cash flows at 1000 Crores and the\\nremaining money what we invested towards acquisition.\\nThe point that I would like to highlight is we have been seeing significant amount of\\ngrowth in our presales number most of you have tracked year-after-year from pre-COVID\\nyear of 2800 we moved to 5000 plus Crores of sales and then to 10000 plus Crores of\\nsales and last year close to 13000 Crores of sales and this year we get it for more.\\nSubstantial amount of money that we have invested in acquisitions for the new launches\\nbetween 5-6 projects at Bengaluru which is getting launched as we mentioned Prestige\\nPark Grove, Prestige city Hyderabad, Ocean Towers Marine Line, Prestige Nautilus at\\nWorli and one more project that we took over from the funds belonged to other\\ndevelopers. These 5-6 projects we have invested around 3000 Crores towards business\\ndevelopment and all of these projects will be launched from now to maximum period of\\n15 months or so, so lot of unlocking will happen from these investments as and when\\nthese projects get launched. The reason for slight increase in the debt also is driven by\\nthis kind of acquisition that we have done which according to us will set up a good base\\nfor us to clock good numbers in terms of presales and also help us grow if the demand\\nand the momentum continues in the same fashion and the macroeconomics support grow\\non that number next year because as you know in the real estate we cannot buy land\\ntoday and launch tomorrow there is always a lead time so these investments will result in\\ngreat presales numbers this year and as well as next year. With this brief I would like to\\nopen the forum for questions and answers.\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. First question is\\nfrom the line of Pritesh Sheth from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead.\\n\\nPritesh Sheth:\\n\\nHi thanks for taking my question. First question is on 1300 Crores land investment this\\nquarter if you can provide some breakup of on which all lands what we have spent for\\nbecause in the pipeline obviously I do not see any new projects getting added, but\\ndefinitely it would be for some older projects so if you can just help me with the breakup\\nor some key investments that includes that 1300 Crores?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nSure definitely, yes you are right. It is somewhat the balance payment that we have to\\nmake for the projects which are already in pipeline those include Prestige Nautilus at\\nWorli, Prestige Ocean Towers at Marine Lines, Prestige Park Grove that we are going to\\nlaunch and two projects at Electronics City as well as Bannerghatta Road and 175 Crores\\nof additional investment that we have made into REIT consolidate our holding with retail\\n\\nPage 4 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

In case the partner cannot fund\\nobviously he will start diluting his share. As of now there is no such discussions but\\nobviously when we are funding more and the partner is unable to fund then obviously we\\nwill have to dilute him but as of today if a partner has committed that he will bring his\\ncontribution wherever required and when it does not come obviously it needs to be done.\\n\\nAdhidev Chattopadhyay: This final question is on our debt levels in our analyst meet we had given roadmap on\\nhow the debt would pan out over the next four to five years now that we have done the\\nstake acquisition, so considering all of this would you like to revise like in terms of\\nwhere our debt numbers would be possible in the next 12 to 18 months in absolute terms?\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nAs of now we have robust cash flows coming in from residential business and also the\\ndebt on our hotel portfolio is compared to the investment that has been made and the\\nvalue of the hotels is very minimal, in all of this we will definitely have some positive\\ncash flows and this will help us to go through this and any debt is required to complete\\nthe capex project we are on yes the debt will come in but the balance sheet is strong\\nenough to take that debt and as and when the project gets completed it will start fructify\\nso I do not see any stress in that mode.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nJust to add to what MD is mentioning in this quarter we have guided in terms of debt\\nequity ratio so what happens this quarter as I mentioned is our turnover number is low,\\nbut as you know what we have sold during the earlier year will start coming.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nWe had some 40 to 50000 Crores worth of unrecognized revenue.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nRevenue recognition will start coming in once the topline increases automatically net\\nworth will go up and debt equity will be back so this is only transition but by the time we\\nreach FY2024 debt level will be where we have guided.\\n\\nAdhidev Chattopadhyay: Ex any stake acquisitions our debt should be around 7 to 7500 Crores in absolute net debt\\ntowards the end of March 2024 is that a reasonable assumption to work with?\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nYes but having said that that may still continue to be at whatever we have guided at\\naround 0.5.\\n\\nPage 7 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

We have not yet drawn the money I think\\nwe will complete the documentation and start drawing the money by the end of this\\nmonth.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nHas the work started because the BKC projects are still showing in the upcoming so it\\nhas not moved to the ongoing project I think last time you said that you are already\\nappointed a contractor what is this contract so if you can update us on the status of the\\nproject?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nWork has started, excavation is going on, L&T is the contractor so whatever work is\\nhappening is money from our contribution as equity and moment the financial closure\\ngets done that much more gunpowder will be available for this.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nLiberty Towers is already in the ongoing project, BKC is moved but then in this quarter\\nyou will see that from upcoming to ongoing by the end of this quarter which is as of June\\n30, 2023 what you are seeing.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nSecond question is on the Ocean Towers so we have bought out the partner stake, but the\\narea share has gone down quarter-on-quarter I think in the last presentation we had about\\n1 million square feet of area and now it is 0.81 so why is that?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThere was a partner in Ocean Towers this is a bought out client we took it over Edelweiss,\\nthat land is 100% bought in Ocean Towers.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nQuarter-on-quarter why the area share has gone down, 60% is our economic interest?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nEconomic interest has also been the same, from the beginning it has been the same, it is\\njust that in the final whatever the sanction part that we have submitted for the approval\\nthere could be a small difference about 1.35 total developable area and 0.81 is our share\\n\\nPage 8 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\nof the area, it has been the same. Little change in the final drawing could have taken\\nplace.\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nOur economic interest is 60% so who has the balance 40% in this?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThis is done in entity called Prestige Projects Private Limited where earlier HDFC was\\nholding the stake and that was bought out by the family office so this project is\\nhappening in the Prestige.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\n60% will be the main entity and I think 40% is the family office.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nFamily office whose family office, is there some other investor, third party investor?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nJust to tell you Prestige Projects Private Limited PPPL is the SPV that had 60% from the\\nlisted company, 40% was held by HK. HK stake when they were exiting at that point in\\ntime was bought from HK directly by the family office this was three years ago. Project\\nis executed in that SPV because we had cash flows in that SPV.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nOkay sure and Sir our debt has now already gone up, early debt is at 4400 Crores our\\ndebt is now I think 6400 Crores and we have about 17000 Crores of capex to be incurred\\nincluding all hospitality, retail and office so even if we assume that 30:70 mix or even if I\\ntake 50:50 mix so the capex that will go up is almost 8 to 9000 Crores so we may end up\\nsomewhere in the debt number of 15 to 16000 Crores by that time all these assets gets\\ncompleted so is it the right assumption that we may touch close to about 15 to 16000\\nCrores of debt?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThree things that we need to look at because of the growth that is happening in\\ndevelopment especially residential which is unprecedented. We have grown from 5000 to\\n10000, 10000 to 13000 and this year looking at 16 to 18000 Crores and we need to have\\nthat much of inventory to sell and also the projects and the planning for the next year\\nbecause there is always a lead time, so our investment to business development have\\nsignificantly gone up that is why across five projects that I mentioned outflow has been\\n3000 Crores. All of these five projects will get launched from quarter-on-quarter in the\\nnext 12 to 15 months that money will get unlocked. I want you to see our slide 15 where\\nthe free cash flows that we can generate from residential business as I mentioned\\nessential developmental business even this quarter we had 1000 plus Crores of operating\\npositive cash flow. The ongoing project have got a surplus of 8500 Crores, upcoming\\nprojects have got a surplus of around 21,000 Crores both put together close to 29000 to\\n\\nPage 9 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\n30000 Crores of free cash flows that we can generate from residential, so this is the\\npotential. Even if we have to fund one third from residential to capex project and borrow\\nthe remaining from the bank by the time the commercial projects gets completed we will\\nhave enough cash flows to pay back those money and retire the debt. Our goal is lease\\nrental discounting. We should look at why is the debt number high and what is that we\\nare doing with that money and how are we meeting the growth.\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nYour ready debt is 4000 will it be the pick because I understand you will have LRDs on\\ncommercial and you are going almost to 4000 Crores on rental so which itself is huge and\\ncan support the debt number on the capex especially on the LRD side it can support it but\\nprimarily on the residential debt which is at 4400 so how do you see that behaving over\\nthe next few quarters?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nWhat you said is correct. Whatever we have to spend we have to spend but what you\\nneed to look at also is if we have to spend that much of money on capex portfolio we will\\nhave a overall rental income of 3500 Crores, if you apply 8% cap on that roughly the\\nvalue of that will be around 45000 Crores by itself that is the value portfolio that we have\\nand the debt whatever you are mentioning we may have to incur to build process,\\nabsolutely yes but with that debt outflow our construction cost spend will look at the\\nvalue that we are creating.\\n\\nParikshit Kandpal:\\n\\nThe only question is whether you will monetize the part of that rental portfolio of 45000\\nCrores even at 10% can give you a large 5 to 6000 Crores worth of roll down in terms of\\ncapital and reduce the debt significantly?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThe thing is these options of monetizing always exist, which we did one-and-a-half years\\nago with Blackstone yielding portfolio some of them are under construction. We can do\\none more. The key investors need to strengthen the relationship further and invest in\\nsome more of our assets. There are other key investors who want to evaluate our ongoing\\noffice and the retail portfolio but by then that is a difficult choice as to make when is the\\nideal time, is it now when the assets are under construction or is it when the assets are\\nready or should we at all do this kind of divestment or should we go and list in a public\\nplatform so these option exits, one thing I want to reiterate and assure all the analyst and\\ninvestor community is that the quality of asset that we are building are world class and\\nthey will be the sought after asset with the value creation that is happening. How to\\nunlock there is always an option that is available. We can do it now if we choose to make\\nit lesser value or do it once they are ready when they get better value, go to public market\\nonce and for all we may get even better value.\\n\\nPage 10 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

Of course\\nthere is a lot more time and lot more work needs to be done on Jijamata Nagar and we are\\nnot going to see the light of day in the next one or two quarters. There is at least a good\\nsix quarters away. In the meanwhile Nautilus is almost ready and the type of location we\\nhave I think is second to none with great spectacular views and the design itself we have\\ndone it in such a way that it is neither too large or too luxurious or not too small so I\\nbelieve that there will be a good appetite for it and it is going to find a good response\\nfrom the market.\\n\\nRunit Kapoor:\\n\\nSo in Jijamata Nagar I would say like you are looking a mix of commercial as well as\\nresidential but I am saying are you looking at mid income housing?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nA complete mix that Jijamata Nagar there will be a mix, it is a different type of product\\nthat will be done, we still honestly have not put pen to pencil, of course there will be a\\nlarge component of redevelopment also there because we have to rehabilitate the slums\\nalso, so yes it is a very different type of project.

My first question is while\\nenter into an agreement where there is family ownership in one project and company\\nownership at the other given that the entire business will be done within the listed entity?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nWhen we are doing the Prestige city which was in the SPV called Prestige Projects\\nPrivate Limited, List Co had 60% stake and HKL had 40% stake. The overall holding\\n\\nPage 12 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\ncost of 60% for List Co was little under 100 Crores. When HKL wanted to exit their ask\\nwas around 440 Crores or 40% and at that point in time when you had 60% holding\\ncoming to you at less than 100 Crores so by 40% at 440 Crores did not make meaningful\\nsense and at the same time we did not want them to go and sell it off to an outsider and\\nbring one outside equity partner. We had those cash flows. We said okay at that number\\ninstead of going for an outsider why cannot we look at it we took clearances, what are the\\ncompliances and that money got invested rightly so because instead of List Co investing\\n440 Crores to get extra stake that money got invested in various other projects and the\\nbusiness development happened. Once the project got launched there was a surplus cash\\nflow in that SPV itself so that SPV invested in couple of projects that is how some\\nprojects have come into the SPV. When we did financial transaction in that SPV there\\nwas on up streaming of cash flows in the project gets completed so therefore that SPV\\nwith additional cash flow that was there after the project got launched invested those\\nmoney and acquired to other projects.\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nSo which are those, one is Ocean Towers, is Nautilus also a part of similar structure?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nNautilus also has been a part of similar structure yes. List Co owns 60% when it comes to\\nOcean Towers, 51% in Nautilus.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nIn presentation you said it is 40%. Secondly what are your thoughts on future business\\ndevelopment, what kind of capital are you likely to allocate over next two years for\\nbusiness development and what is the balance to spend for any business development\\nactivities that you have already done?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nWe have enough in pipeline for fiscal FY2024 and FY2025 to launch, now if any\\nbusiness development activity to do this year that is going to be for FY2026 and to clock\\nnumbers of 18,000 to 20,000 Crores of sales and on average I think investment into\\nbusiness development should be in the range of 4 to 5000 Crores a year. This consists of\\nmix of JV and outright buy and all of that.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nUnderstood and in terms of cash flow for Jijamata Nagar are these already a part of your\\nupcoming cash flow projection?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nIt is.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nSo this amount of roughly 5000 Crores is that all or there could be more potential in\\nterms of area to be sold?\\n\\nPage 13 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

Right now we are looking at a\\nmaster planning and also cleaning up and acquiring the entire land. We have not gone to\\nthe details of exactly what should be the composition, what should be the mix and all of\\nthat, now if we choose to exploit more and do only for sales these numbers can go up.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nSo 5,000 Crores is your share of cash flow from sales and what will be the construction\\ncost that you will have to spend on the 3 million square feet?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nWe are at around Rs.5000 a square foot, 1500 Crores.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nBut your attributable cash flow is only 5000 Crores and you will have to spend 1500\\nCrores in this?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nMumbai overall 3 million square foot the total number is 65000 if you take the total cash\\nflow has been shown.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nRoughly 20000 Crores, on 20000 Crores you have 26% stake which is 5000 Crores.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nOur spend is also proportionate, so 3.05 multiplied by 5000 into 26%, so we spend\\naround 400 Crores our share of spend.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nSo on 400 Crores of investment you get basically 5000 Crores is that how one should\\nread it?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nProportionate yes. Some amount of land cost have been incurred and the balance\\nwhatever need to be incurred will be incurred that will also be proportionate again.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nHow much is that likely to be just to understand the potential of the project profitability?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nWe need to spend another 150 to 200 Crores.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nHow much have you already paid for it?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nLittle over 150 Crores.\\n\\nPuneet Gulati:\\n\\nSeems to be a super deal.

              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nGood evening. Venkat you said earlier that our spend on JDS would be about 4000 to\\n5000 Crores annually and if you look at our cash flows or other like operating cash flow\\nrun rate which is again in the 4000 to 5000 Crores run rate annually and then we have\\ncapex of 15000 Crores which we will spend over the next five years realistically where\\ndo you think the debt will peak out here at what levels in absolute terms because again\\nlike these cash flow numbers look quite, quite aggressive?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nKunal right now 1000 Crores of free cash flow that you see is at a current run rate that we\\nare operating. The business development outlay that we indicated is for the presales of\\naround 20000 Crores run rate. It is much, much more than the current operating levels\\nthat also are a mix of some JDS and also outright buy all put together the outlay that we\\nneed to have. Now that be the number there is enough amount of residential cash flow\\nthat we can generate to reinvest. This quarter we have got 1000 Crores of positive cash\\nflows, but the quarter in which we have completions a lot of money comes at the time of\\nhanding over. That quarter positive cash flows will be a lot higher so it also depends upon\\nwhat is getting launched and majority of the cash flows in this quarter are from the sale of\\nLavender Fields where booking amount only has come after that installment money will\\nkeep coming so we are confident that we will be able to generate around 2000 to 2500\\nCrores of positive cash flow from developmental business per quarter.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nGoing by the number that you are putting out right say 30-35% operating cash flow\\nmargin on the collections and even if you assume say 20000 Crores of presales and\\nassuming that collections also like reach 20000 Crores which generally is about 80% odd\\nwe would still be in that 5000, 6000 Crores of operating cash flow range and then again\\nthe 5000 Crores spend on land and then 5000 Crores on capex maybe it just still looks a\\nlittle bit of stretch, does this factor your residential cash flow right?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nStill we stabilize with those numbers. See if you look at some of these projects I am\\nlooking at the current market value. Projects where we have deferred outflow last year we\\nwere selling at 20% less than what we have sold this year. Do not look only at cash flow\\nlook at the margins that we generate also. That is why I said the cash flows could be\\nlumpy we hold 15-20% of the project in the completion and when we sell that in that\\nquarter with no additional outflow because construction must have been over projects\\nmust have been completed. If you look at our completed inventory from last quarter to\\nthis quarter it is down by a million. Like that because we did not have much of\\ncompletion this quarter if you see and the quarter that we have high completion and\\nwhere complete inventory gets sold there is no construction obligation, in the completed\\n\\nPage 15 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\ninventory so all of it will be free cash flows so you look at overall do not look at a\\nparticular quarter.\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nMy second question is on when we highlighted this whole growth plan on the annuity\\nbusiness and the kind of capex that we were planning we did put it out as a strategy that\\nwe will do part strata to manage the debt levels, has anything changed over there because\\nnow actually we are doing reverse of that like we are buying out stake instead of doing\\nstrata so just any change in the strategy or we are still considering doing strata in future\\nin these assets?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nDefinitely do not want to do strata if it all we do something we may end up as an equity\\npartner at some point of time or the other.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nKunal just to answer your earlier question little in more detail you can see residential\\nongoing and upcoming we have given you free cash flows that we can generate okay so\\n29900 Crores across ongoing and upcoming which is huge in number so that will be over\\na period of next four years that means around 7500 Crores of free cash flows a year. Even\\nif you were to deploy around 4500 to 5000 we still are left with 2500 Crores of positive\\ncash flows.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nThese are still pre tax and pre overheads right, these cash flows?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nIf you see slide #29 it will include all the payment, sales, marketing, overhead, taxes.\\nThis is after a free cash flow of 1000 Crores.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nNo I am talking about free cash flow.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nEven those also. Unless the rates change current numbers have been factored in.\\n\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nFair enough and my last question was you said earlier about bringing in equity partners just\\non that front when we divested our stake to Blackstone we were nearing debt levels of\\nabout 9500 Crores, we are currently at about 7500 Crores right at what stage would you\\nlook at doing that at the asset level or even say doing equity dilution at the entity level if\\nat all?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nKunal one thing when you are comparing you should also compare the current scale of\\noperations and the current market growth. When we had 8500 Crores of debt from\\nBlackstone our presales numbers, the peak that we have reached was 5000 Crores or\\n\\nPage 16 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\nbusiness was operating at 5000 Crores. Now we are operating our business at 13000\\nCrores and maybe hopefully if all go well as planned this year it would be around 16000\\nto 18000 Crores. In that like you should see these numbers, accounting numbers are\\ncompletely different because they come for revenue recognition as and when the projects\\ngets completed but the scale of operations right now is different.\\nKunal Lakhan:\\n\\nSure thanks so much and all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Next question is from the line of Saurabh from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSaurabh:\\n\\nSo just two questions, so one is Venkat around this commercial project in Worli so what\\ngives you confidence that takes off because that area has a lot of oversupply and your exJV partner is actually struggling there so when you did your market research around this\\nLiberty Towers what gave you this confidence that this can be done because this is a first\\nlarge one which should come up in Mumbai so if you can just talk about that and any risk\\nguardrails you have put in there, the second is on the cash flow slide what is this 109\\nCrores in the finance cost, is this the other income or this is something else?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nWith the type of product that we are doing I thought Venkat will answer that and he is\\nlooking at me to answer it. We are completely confident that it will meet a huge response,\\nnot a small response so nothing to worry on that.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThe kind of development that we are doing given the specifications and the futuristic\\nbuilding we are confident that this will be much sought after building and we do not have\\nany second thoughts on that. We have done our own analysis before embarking on this. In\\nfact there is lot of contemplation that happened; there was lot of suggestion that came\\nsaying that we should make it as a residential project.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nIn fact there is a lot more residential so I do not want to go through that route at all.\\n\\nSaurabh:\\n\\nSo that is what I want to get through as to what kind of research did you do to kind of\\ncome up with this conclusion that there is demand for 4 million square foot office space?\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nIt is not 4 million it is 2 million in Mahalaxmi and for a brand new building with a brand\\nnew infrastructure and the type of products that we are making there will be quite a lot of\\ndemand for it because not only the existing new demand but there will be a lot of\\nrelocations that will happen because everybody would like to have new office for\\n\\nPage 17 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

Next question is from the line of Atul Tiwari from Citi Group. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAtul Tiwari:\\n\\nThanks a lot for the opportunity. Sir just one question. Obviously Prestige has been\\nlaunching and selling and delivering a lot of projects over the past 10 years we have\\nalways seen it has been the best in the sector, but obviously in the last cycle even though\\nwe were selling a lot, the debt built-up and we had to sell our rental projects, so what we\\nare doing differently in this cycle because very frankly one recipe for disaster in the\\nsector has been ramping up the residential business with the help of the debt that we have\\nseen across the companies over past 15 years and if you could share your thoughts on that\\npoint and what we are doing differently this time to make sure that the debt is sustainable\\nand no cash flow issues later?\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThere are two things; one of the reasons why debt has gone up compared to last year is\\nalso the pace of growth, the way of adding additional capital by way of any dilutions, etc.\\nWe are meeting this growth either through internal accruals or debt. You would not have\\nseen in the past here if you look at three years ago from 5000 Crores to now around\\n16000 Crores is three times the growth 300% growth and we need to gear up for it first\\none and second is there were concerns earlier also we are looking at creating these assets\\n\\nPage 18 of 19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Prestige Estates Projects Limited\\nAugust 09, 2023\\nwhich are much more valuable and can give much more returns than our borrowing costs\\nand what the amount of money that we are borrowing, so at any given point while\\nanswering to earlier question I said the options exist for us to bring in a partner and\\nreduce the debt or complete this asset or sell it to somebody at a higher value or create\\nthis and go to the public market and unlock your capital so these options exist, see we are\\nnot taking this money and investing in some lands which are futuristic which can be\\nmonetized 10 years, 20 years, 30 years or so no that is not what we are doing. The proof\\nof pudding is every year, every quarter we have been showing the growth in terms of\\noperations and every bit of this money is going to take the organization to the next level\\nof growth. So the asset that we are creating, the free cash flows that we are going to\\ngenerate out of residential will definitely take care and they are 3-4 times more worth\\nthan the debt that we carry in the books.\\nAtul Tiwari:\\n\\nOkay Thanks.\\n\\nVenkat Narayana:\\n\\nThe overall debt that is there in the balance sheet right now is equivalent to our free cash\\nflows from the ongoing projects, all of it if you were to use to repay the debt it will be\\nzero but we also need to look at the growth.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will take this as the last question for the day. I\\nwould now like to hand the conference over to the management for the closing\\ncomments.\\n\\nIrfan Razack:\\n\\nThanks everybody. It has been quite an insightful interaction. We definitely have heard\\nyou and we have also understood the concerns, but nevertheless we are quite confident in\\nwhat we are doing and we are sure we are going to bring more and more value as we go\\non to the company and believe me residential is doing well.

There is enough demand in the\\nmarket and there is a lot of consolidation also which is helping our calls and by sheer\\ndelivery there is a confidence and that is why customers are coming to us as compared to\\nany other developers, so that helps our plans.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you very much.

              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nRishi Basu\\nVery good evening, everyone and thank you for joining us today at our Fourth Quarter\\nFinancial Results Press Conference. Glad to see a full house and we'd like to welcome our\\nfriends from media, our leaders from Infosys. My name is Rishi and on behalf of Infosys, I'd\\nlike to welcome our leaders, Salil and Nilanjan to this press conference. As always, like I say,\\nwe request one question from each media person, so that we can accommodate everyone over\\nthe next hour.\\nWith that, let me invite our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Salil Parekh for his opening remarks.\\nOver to you, Salil.\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks, Rishi, and good evening everyone here for joining in, and thank you for being here on\\nthe campus. We had an excellent full year performance in Financial Year 2023, with a growth\\nof 15.4% in constant currency. Our digital business grew at 25.6%, now being 62.9% of our\\noverall revenue. And our core services grew as well at 1.9%. We had 95 large deals with a\\nvalue of $9.8 bn for the year, 40% of which were net new.\\nOur operating margin for the full year was at 21%, and our attrition has continued to decline in\\neach quarter of the year, including in Q4.\\nWe are leveraging generative AI capabilities for our clients and within the company today, we\\nhave active programs and projects with clients, working with generative AI platforms to\\naddress specific areas, processes, and libraries within their business. We have trained opensource generative AI platforms on our own internal software development libraries. We\\nanticipate generative AI to provide more opportunities for work with our clients and to enable\\nus to improve our own productivity.\\nIn Q4, we saw changes in the market environment. During the quarter, we saw unplanned\\nproject ramp-downs in some of our clients and delays in decision-making which resulted in\\nlower volumes. In addition, we had some onetime revenue impact. While we saw some signs\\nof stabilization in March, the environment remains uncertain. This led to our Q4 year-on-year\\ngrowth of 8.8% in constant currency and quarter-over-quarter decline of 3.2%.\\nPage 3 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nOur operating margin was resilient at 21% for the quarter. We had $2.1 bn in large deals in the\\nquarter. Our pipeline of large deals is extremely strong. Several of these are mega deals and\\nseveral of them are opportunities for cost and efficiency programs within clients and\\nconsolidation opportunities. Based on our sustained momentum in the financial year '23, the\\nstrong pipeline of opportunities, especially the ones in cost efficiency and consolidation, while\\nalso keeping in mind the uncertain environment, our revenue growth guidance for this financial\\nyear is 4% to 7% in constant currency. Our operating margin guidance for the financial year is\\n20% to 22%.\\nThank you, and over to you, Rishi, for our questions.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you, Salil. We will now open the floor for questions. Joining Salil is Mr. Nilanjan Roy,\\nChief Financial Officer, Infosys.\\nWith that, our first question is from Ritu Singh from CNBCTV18.\\nRitu Singh\\nHi Salil, Hi Nilanjan. Your constant currency revenue decline for the quarter is far worse than\\nwhat the street was expecting. And then that sort of explains why your full year revenue growth\\nguidance is missed, what you guided at 16% - 16.5%. I just wanted to understand where are\\nyou seeing softness? I remember reading your comments that your exposure to US banks isn't\\nthat large. What are the verticals that are seeing softness? And also on your margin guidance,\\nwhich now for FY’24, you’ve brought to about 20% to 22%. Again, last year, we thought it\\nwas an aberration because of higher wage bills, and the expectation was that it would be\\nbrought back to 21% to 23%, which is not the case. Could you tell us a bit more about why\\nthis?\\nAnd a second question on attrition as well, which has been coming down. If you expect that\\ntrend to continue in your hiring plans for the year, please? Thank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\n\\nPage 4 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nLet me start off with the market. Nilanjan will share a little bit about the margin and the other\\npoints we will come back to as well.\\nOn what we saw in Q4, during the quarter, we saw some ramp-downs which were unplanned,\\nand these were across different sectors. We saw some in Telco. We saw some in Hitech, some\\nin Retail and within Financial Services, it was on mortgages that we have talked about in the\\npast, in Asset Management and Investment Banking. So those were the areas in which we saw\\nthings which were unplanned. In addition to that, we saw some onetime impact in the quarter.\\nNow in terms of the margin, go ahead please.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, I'll take that. So, we have ended the year, as you know, at 21%, and this has been pretty\\nstable as the year has gone by. So, 21% was the full year margin as the exit margin as well.\\nAnd in a way, it's a midpoint between 20% and 22%. It gives us the flexibility in this year as\\nwell. So, we will have some headwinds which we will see with compensation, we will have\\nsome travel coming back. But we know with things like utilization, more automation, etc., we\\nalso have a runway to increase the margins. But this gives us the necessary flexibility into next\\nyear.\\nRitu Singh\\nWith Infosys, like even with your revenue guidance last year, you started with something, and\\nyou kept increasing it every quarter. Should we expect some sort of upside risk to these\\nguidance figures you have given us for this year as well for FY’24?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, the guidance we have given is based on what we see from the deals we won $9.8 bn in the\\nyear, plus what we see with a steady business and the outlook we have in the demand\\nenvironment today. So that is the way we build our guidance. That is the way we look at it. We\\ndon't have a view on what will change as the year progresses.\\nNilanjan Roy\\n\\nPage 5 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nSorry, what was the question again?\\nRitu Singh\\nIt was on attrition and hiring.\\nSalil Parekh\\nAttrition and hiring.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nFor next year?\\nRitu Singh\\nYes, for FY’24.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, FY’24. So, looking at the volumes, one is, we have a lot of bench with us. In fact, over a\\nlong period of time, we have kept this bench. They are ready to move into production projects.\\nBut of course, they will take time as volumes come in their own pace. And of course, we have\\nan agile model of hiring off campus as well. So as demand picks up, we have that flexibility as\\nwell. So, I think our model in terms of hiring has got enough flexibility to take care of new\\nvolumes. In any case, we have a rich bench, 80% utilization is what we have, and usually, we\\nhave operated well above that.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Shilpa Phadnis from The Times of India.\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nI just wanted to understand from you, if you look at the guidance for the next year, it looks\\nreally understated. And way back in 2016 is when you had the low single-digit guidance that\\nwas re-revised downwards. I just wanted to understand from you, where are the headwinds\\nPage 6 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\ncoming from? Is it largely in BFSI, last quarter also, you called out some account headwinds.\\nCan you please take us through that?\\nSecond, you said onetime impact. So, is it largely related to ramp-down or any other clientrelated issues? Can you please help us with that?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on the first, I'll address it, Nilanjan will come back on the second one. We saw during the\\nquarter certain clients where we saw these ramp-downs, which were not planned. And they\\nwere across the Telco sector, Retail, Hitech and Financial Services, parts of which mainly\\nfocused on Mortgages, Asset Management, and Investment Banking. So it was across those\\nindustries that we saw some of the constraints that came up.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nOn the revenues onetime, so most of the decline in revenue actually was from volume and the\\nimpact of revenue onetime is a combination of cancellations actually, exactly what you said.\\nSo, the combination of cancellations and also some specific client issues. So, it's a combination\\nof that, but most of the decline actually has been from volume.\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nI had one last question. With the two presidents leaving the organization, do you see some sort\\nof a restructuring that you are going to announce, you're going to break up some of the verticals\\nwhich are anyway monolithic and you going to break it down into smaller business units, is\\nthat plan underway? And you ventured into the delayering exercise- top delayering, so I just\\nwanted to understand from you that you have not called out replacements for the two presidents.\\nIs Infosys breaking away from the past in terms of doing away with the president structure?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, we have announced and rolled out internally a structure, which is focused on delivery with\\nthe exit when Ravi left. We are in position to now roll out the structure that would be for\\nFinancial Services as we move ahead. What we see is within Infosys, we have a strong\\nPage 7 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nleadership team. And so, we are fortunate that the leaders are coming from inside and then we\\nsee more and more at the next level. There is no delayering plan within Infosys at all.\\nOur organization structure really is something we are building, which is agile and also quite\\nsolid to deliver our consistent trajectory that we have been driving through. We have, as you\\nknow, growth drivers on digital and growth drivers on cost and automation. And so those are\\nthe ones that we'll continue to drive. And we have probably the best delivery organization in\\nthe industry. So, we want to continue to enhance that with the team we have.\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nSo, the current responsibilities will be split between other leaders in the organization?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSorry?\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nThe current responsibilities of BFSI?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThe leaders within the company will step up and also in delivery it is done. The next one will\\nbe done in the next few weeks.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Jochelle Mendonca from ET Prime.\\nJochelle Mendonca\\nHello, I want clarification on something you have said in the press release. You' have said that\\nyou have expanded your internal program on efficiency and cost to build a higher path to\\nmargins. I am asking this specifically because I am looking at headcount, and headcount fell in\\nthis quarter, but it fell more on the software professionals while sales and support staff actually\\nwent up marginally. So, could you give me some clarity on what this efficiency program is and\\nPage 8 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nhow it is feeding into how you look at the sales staff and what augments or detractions you\\nmight make on that front?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThat I think is a very critical program. We were running it. In fact, Nilanjan was driving that\\nwith a very strong team. We have expanded the attention to that program during the last quarter.\\nWe have several methods in which we can do better in that program, whether that relates to\\nautomation, it relates to pyramid, it relates to onsite mix, relates to subcontractors, relates to\\ntravel. And also relating to pricing and how we can drive that within our system, given the\\ninflation that all of us have seen.\\nWhat we are communicating with that is that program gets a very focused attention. And we\\nhave within our internal way of looking at it, a path to bring us to the aspired margin that we\\nwant, because we want to be at that margin as we go ahead. Having said that, we have low\\nutilization that Nilanjan mentioned. We are going to make sure that we look after our people\\nwith that commitment. We are going to make sure that we continue with the training, and that\\nis an area we will continue our focus on. We are not going to take some short-term actions\\nagainst that and that will be a way to build it because over time, that is a team that will start to\\nwork on projects as well.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Chandra Srikanth from Moneycontrol.\\nChandra Srikanth\\nGoing by the guidance that you mentioned, can you give us a sense of the incremental revenues\\nthat you will be adding for FY’24? Because based on the back of the envelope calculation, I\\nthink it will come up to some $300 mn to $500 mn compared to the $3 bn that you added in\\nthe previous fiscal. So, can you give us a sense of how much incremental revenues you expect\\nto add in FY’24?\\nAnd Salil, what are you hearing from clients? I mean, yesterday, the TCS management\\nmentioned that discretionary projects are getting deferred. There are no cancellations or budget\\nPage 9 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\ncuts, but clients are spending wisely. If you can give us a sense of what the conversations are\\nlike, what kind of deal discussions are happening, and how impacted are you by the regional\\nbanking crisis in the US? I think JPMorgan recently said that you and TCS have the highest\\nexposure to regional banks in the US. So, if you can give us a sense of that because financial\\nservices have declined quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThe first part is on the regional banks, Nilanjan will come back with that. But on the first part\\n-- two parts what you asked. One, on the incremental revenue, so as you know, we don't give a\\nspecific dollar number for that. But our guidance very clearly allows you to interpret it as 4%\\nto 7% constant currency growth on the base, which now is closed on March 31. So, both\\nreported and constant currency, we have those numbers. But that is our guidance, which will\\ntherefore give you the incremental revenue.\\nOn what our clients are telling us. Now several industries where we have talked about,\\nTelecom, Retail, Hitech, and parts of Financial Services, there are some clients which are\\nseeing in their own business, whatever constraints they're seeing with the economic\\nenvironment. As a consequence, we have noticed that some decisions were made during the\\nquarter to stop some parts of the programs, not everything, but some parts of the program. And\\nthat's what we observed in the quarter. Plus, what Nilanjan and I also shared, there was some\\none-time impact in the quarter.\\nNow, what we see going ahead, we saw some stabilization in March, but the demand\\nenvironment is still uncertain. In the last quarter, we saw that certain banking situations were\\nin the US and European geographies, impacting decision-making across the board. With that\\nin mind, we are working very closely with our clients and supporting them, making sure that\\nwe remain committed to our clients as they go through their way of dealing with the situation\\nthat's changing. And we believe that as we did in the past, the clients connect with us will help\\nus massively in the future as well.\\nHaving said that, we have an extremely large pipeline, the largest pipeline we have seen in a\\nlong while, while there is still a slowing in the cycle of closing the deals, the deals are very\\n\\nPage 10 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nstrong, and some of them are mega deals. So, we feel good that there is a pipeline focused on\\ncost and efficiency, and consolidation.\\nChandra Srikanth\\nI think the Street was expecting 21% to 23% and I think you've given 20% to 22%. So again,\\nwhat are the pressure points there? Is it rising onsite cost?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo, like I said, we have ended the year at 21% and in fact, the quarter closed at 21% and the\\nfull year is 21%. So, we have seen a very steady 21% and frankly, that is the midpoint between\\n20% to 22% and it gives us the flexibility to look at certain headwinds if they arise. There will\\nbe some increases like I just mentioned earlier, it will be in terms of travel and compensation.\\nAnd of course, we have the whole benefit of utilization, the pyramid, etc., to work. So, I think\\nthat's a fair range. And of course, our aspiration continues to be to improve our margin profile.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. Next question is from Sai from The Economic Times.\\nSai Ishwarbharath\\nHi, gentlemen. So, looking at the guidance, I just wanted to ask, even last year, you had given\\nguidance and you had kept updating it, right? So, would you call this some sort of a misstep\\nlike kind of seeing the demand forecast as overestimating demand? And also, I wanted to know\\nyou were saying that a lot of project cancellations and the one-time impact were there. So, has\\nthat impact subsided, or should we also expect similar pressure in the pipeline that's coming?\\nAlso, for Nilanjan, I wanted to know the campus hiring target for FY’24. Thanks.\\nSalil Parekh\\nMany of the things that Nilanjan and I shared earlier today were things that happened in the\\nquarter. For example, some of the clients decided to slow down or stop some of the projects.\\nSo, these were things we had not seen at the start or at the end of last quarter, and that's what\\nwe felt. We have also seen some of that stabilizing in March, but the demand environment is\\nPage 11 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nuncertain. So, we are making sure that we keep that in mind as we look ahead and remain agile\\nas we look ahead.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo, on the freshers, like I said, we have a very rich bench now. We have hired more than 50,000,\\nand we have said, we will hire 50,000. We actually had, I think, hired 51,000-odd last year.\\nAnd a lot of them on the bench are getting skilled, are getting trained. So, we have quite a\\nleeway for the next few quarters in terms of the availability of freshers. And of course, with\\nour agile model of doing both college and off-campus recruitment, we can always turn that up.\\nSo, we have no specific number for FY’24 at this stage. We have enough, actually, today sitting\\non the bench.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Haripriya Sureban from The Hindu BusinessLine.\\nHaripriya Sureban\\nHi guys. Salil, you mentioned about slowdown. I just wanted to understand, is it more\\nsentimental, or is it structural? Why are these deals getting delayed? And on the ChatGPT part\\nthat you mentioned, are there any specific use cases that you guys are working on? And we\\nkeep hearing that ChatGPT could make a job redundant or something like that. So would roles\\nchange, and would the nature of jobs change? And are you internally training employees for\\nthese technologies?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThe first part was?\\nHaripriya Sureban\\nIs it sentimental, around what you are seeing and the client behavior that you are seeing, is it\\nsentimental because everybody is scared or is it structural?\\nSalil Parekh\\nPage 12 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nSo there, what we are seeing is some clients have made a decision to slow down or ramp-down\\nprojects. We see that across the different industries that I mentioned, Telecom, Hitech, Retail,\\nand parts of Financial Services. So, I don't know whether it's sentimental or structural, but we\\nhave seen that as the way the clients have interacted with us. As we were sharing, we saw some\\nstabilization in March, but the environment is uncertain, so we will see how it plays out.\\nOn Generative AI, we are working with multiple platforms. We are working with open-source\\nplatforms, and we are working with proprietary platforms. We have active client projects today.\\nThe projects that we are working on are focused on large models within the client organization\\nfor different areas. And how Generative AI can take advantage of those large models and create\\nsomething more efficient for the client.\\nAnd then, we are working on our own software development tool, on an open-source\\nGenerative AI platform. We are actually working with two of them. And we are building, we\\nare training it on our software development libraries. We have already done that with several\\nof our internal software library elements. And we feel quite good that these things are going to\\nhelp us with client work, so more work and also with productivity.\\nSo, it's really incredible how we think our organization has moved quickly into driving\\nGenerative AI within our business. And it’s now part of all the new training as well because\\nonce you have it for your own software library, you can really deploy it very effectively.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from PP Thimmaya from YourStory.\\nPP Thimmaya\\nHi. Just have two questions. One is the kind of negative growth you saw in this Q4. I understand\\nthe SVB crisis, the banking crisis, the Credit Suisse, and UBS crisis, but was it expected? I\\nmean such kind of deep cuts for Infosys as such from a revenue perspective?\\nAnd secondly, the kind of revenue outlook you have given for the current financial year. Is this\\na long-term trend you are going to see that the overall growth rate is going to be under single\\ndigit -- maybe high single-digit or below 10% kind of thing?\\nPage 13 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, first, every quarter, we look at where our large deals, overall wins plus the current work is.\\nAnd we build in a bottom-up way, what our estimate is and what our forecast is for the period\\nahead for the financial year. And that's the guidance update or change that we gain, and we\\nhave given that consistently over the last several years. We saw a different kind of volume\\nwhen we were at the end of last quarter. And then things changed during the quarter, which is\\nwhat we shared with the projects ramping down.\\nNow looking ahead, first, if you look at, let's just say, the last couple of years, we had 19.7%\\ngrowth the year before, and 15.4% this past year. So, we know that it depends on where the\\neconomic environment is and how we see that. We think our business has two growth drivers.\\nWhen there is a huge change going on within our client organizations and they are putting in\\nlarge investments there.\\nThere is digital transformation, and we have deep capability in that. That comprises the cloud.\\nWe have a very strong capability on Cobalt. And then, when there are different areas where the\\nclient wants to focus on efficiency, costs, and even consolidation. We have a very strong\\ncapability in automation, our own AI that we have used for that in the past. So, we feel\\ncomfortable on both of those dimensions depending on how the economic environment is.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Rukmini Rao from Fortune India.\\nRukmini Rao\\nSalil, this is just an addition to what Shilpa asked on delayering of your leadership, your answer\\nessentially meant that you are not going to have the president structure anymore. Would that\\nbe a fair inference, or do you plan to make changes again?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, what we are doing is for the delivery organization, we have already put in place the new\\nteam and the structure. We have rolled that out. We have a lot of people because we have, I\\nPage 14 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nthink, a very good leadership team within the company. So, a lot of people are really energized\\nand excited with the new roles that they're already playing. On FS, we will be rolling that out\\nin the next few weeks.\\nRukmini Rao\\nOkay. Nilanjan, also, if you can give us some understanding around the reduction in the free\\ncash flows?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo. So I think we had a very good quarter in terms of cash flow at $713 mn.\\nRukmini Rao\\nOn a year-on-year basis?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nWe had an 85% conversion of free cash. And I think as a percent of net profit, that's a very\\ngood conversion because also you have investment into working capital. Last year was very\\nunique. We went above 100%, and the capex was low. We had other working capital benefits.\\nThere were some delays because of COVID in terms of our payments, which we had got\\nbenefits from governments on payments of taxes which came back this year. So otherwise,\\n85% is a very good ratio of conversion.\\nRukmini Rao\\nSalil, also given that, the US macros look so weak and the commentary coming from various\\nquarters also has been the same. So, would that mean that for Indian IT services companies,\\nwould there be opportunities to pick up, like, say, captives of non-core assets of, let's say, big\\nbankers, and are there M&A opportunities that will come out of this slowdown?\\nSalil Parekh\\nWe are seeing very good opportunities in the M&A environment. And this is a good\\nenvironment. We have a very strong balance sheet, a very good way to deploy it. If we find a\\nPage 15 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\ncompany or an entity that fits in strategically, but also culturally and we have a way of\\nintegrating it, we will look at that.\\nRukmini Rao\\nSo, you are on the lookout?\\nSalil Parekh\\nYes, we are -- but we are on the lookout at all times. But yes, this environment is a good\\nenvironment for finding it.\\nRishi Basu\\nThanks, Rukmini. The next question is from Sethuraman NR from Reuters News.\\nSethuraman NR\\nGood evening, gentlemen. So, the question is, this weak, I mean, the soft outlook, is it going\\nto drill down to your plans for hiring next year, as well as the increments and the variable pay?\\nThat is one. And do you see a recovery period over the next few quarters? Like, I mean, one or\\ntwo quarters from where, you feel that the situation in North America will stabilize, or at least,\\nif you have a hint? Also, is the softness overall coming from North America, or you are seeing\\npockets of softness from other regions as well, like Europe? And you also mentioned about the\\nGenerative AI. So, I just want to know whether this is in association with Open AI, where you\\nhave some stake, or how it's going to play?\\nSalil Parekh\\nI'll take the second one, which is on the softness. Nilanjan will come back on the first one. And\\nI'll also talk about Generative AI. So, firstly, our view today is from where we sit today, which\\nis sort of in the middle of April, as we look out to our financial year. We will see how the\\neconomic environment, how the global environment evolves. It's not something that we have\\na clear view of what it will look like for the full year. We have a good approach to building\\nwhat we consider our guidance, based on what work we have already got committed from\\n\\nPage 16 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nclients, what we have seen from the past that's continuing and then what we typically see in\\nQ3, Q4, and in most years. So that's how we have built our guidance, and that's the approach.\\nI think on the geography, we do see, more impact in US and less in Europe. And that's in our\\nnumbers. You see the growth in the full year or even in quarter is stronger in Europe than in\\nUS, even though there is growth in both for the full year.\\nOn Generative AI, with clients, we have many projects going on. We are working on the\\nGenerative AI platform that the client has some interest in, where they have a preference. If\\nthey don't have a preference, we have a certain set of recommendations that we have. We work\\nwith both open-source platforms for clients, but also with platforms that they want, which could\\nbe open sourced or proprietary platforms.\\nFor our own work, we are working on open-source platforms today. And we have the ability\\nto work on any Generative AI platform, because we have our software development libraries,\\nand we can train them on that model.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nOn the first question, of course, as we build out the financial model for the year, we factor in\\nlateral hiring. We factor in attrition, the questions around the freshers in the pipeline. And\\ntherefore, and of course, we have a margin guidance accordingly built in. So, this factors in\\nmany of these things, including things like compensation, travel. So, the model actually puts\\ntogether all these various factors and has that flexibility to change each lever as per where the\\nyear will progress.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next few questions are on text from friends from media who have sent it to us.\\nI just want to make a quick announcement that we are going to consider those questions in the\\ninterest of time which haven't yet been addressed. Most of our questions have been addressed.\\nThe first question on text is from Anisha Jain from ET Now. And Anisha's question, Salil, is\\nto you. Regarding the one-time revenue impact, you said in your opening comments, is there a\\nslowdown caused by a client-specific issue or a specific sector, or is it broad-based?\\nPage 17 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, like we mentioned, I think the majority of the revenue slowdown is from volume. And\\npart of the one-timer, which is on revenue, is a combination of one-time client issues as well\\nas client cancellation, in a way which is a subset of the ramp-downs.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from BQ Prime. Tushar has sent us two questions, one for\\nSalil and one for Nilanjan. For Salil, what is the rationale behind the revision in guidance, given\\nthe weakness in the BFSI space? For Nilanjan, how do we see deal-making and margin panning\\nout over the next two quarters? Is growth likely to return in a hurry?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on the first one, in that sense, there is no revision in the guidance because it is the start of\\nour financial year. So that is our guidance for the year. There is no revision in our guidance.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, I mean, I think, we see the guidance in the context of the macro environment, which we\\nare sitting in now, right? And that, of course, can change. But the other thing is we have a very\\nstrong pipeline. In fact, our large-deal pipeline is the strongest ever we have had. And in a way,\\nthat gives us the confidence, at least as the year progresses, that we will have some conversion\\nof this. And the second half of the year, we will definitely see a definite improvement, which\\nis why the four to seven band, we have widened that band exactly for that reason.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Kushal Gupta from Zee Business to Nilanjan. What are\\nthe tools available at your end to safeguard the margins ahead, given the current scenario\\nremains like this for some more quarters?\\nNilanjan Roy\\n\\nPage 18 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nYes. So, I think four or five of them, which straightaway we know, I think our automation\\ncapabilities are tremendous. I think it is the biggest source of our margin improvement. And of\\ncourse, with new tools coming in, I think we can see more-and-more productivity increases.\\nThe one which is sitting out there really is utilization. I think at 80%, we know we have a large\\nheadroom to improve that. Onsite offshore mix, which post-COVID, slightly went a skew\\nbecause, of course, there was some travel which went back. That now strategically can be\\nlooked at and as we can offshore more work.\\nDefinitely on the pyramid side as well. So, as freshers' go into the pyramid, you will get a\\nbenefit really on the production workforce. So today, the bench has a double whammy on cost\\nbecause you have idle people and, of course, you have a rich pyramid in terms of a very topheavy pyramid. And as freshers' go in, you will be having that benefit as well.\\nSo, there are multiple levers, which we have. Pricing is one of them. Salil mentioned that as\\nwell. We continue to work with our clients where we can put COLA clauses into our deals,\\nwhere we can sell with new innovative commercial constructs. Of course, the environment is\\ntough. The good news is we have not seen, for instance, a return back to a heavy discounting\\nenvironment. We are making sure that we are continuing to push back on our clients on\\ndiscounts, etc., and that really has stayed even during this time.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from CNBC Awaaz for Salil. Has the sentiment worsened\\namong clients? Is there fear of further uncertainty or just caution? Does the uncertainty and\\ndelay in decision-making make it likely to play on the pricing of deals in the coming quarters?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, the way we saw -- during the quarter we saw some of our clients looking at rampdowns in their projects, and then there were some one-time impact on revenue. These were\\nspread across different industries. There were some in Telecom, some in Hitech, Retail and\\nparts of Financial Services. We see some stabilization in March, but the demand environment\\nis uncertain. So, we will watch it and with agility and adapt to it.\\nRishi Basu\\nPage 19 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nThank you, Salil. With that, we come to the end of this press conference. We have perhaps 10\\nmore minutes in case anybody would like to ask another question. Jochelle. Please go ahead - Thimmaya, please use the microphone because we have to record it?\\nThimmaya PP\\nWe would like to know about the sharp drop in client addition in the fourth quarter of FY’23,\\nany particular reason for that?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I think it's probably to be seasonal. I don't have the exact number offhand.\\nThimmaya PP\\nBecause your own fact sheet shows that you added about 115 clients in fourth quarter. And\\nDecember quarter, it was 134, and if you look at a year back…\\nNilanjan Roy\\nThere is nothing specific really at all. I mean, 115 clients on a large base of about 1,900 clients.\\nSo that happens, the ups and downs that happens. We also loose some clients, and we add, in\\nfact, net more than a loss. So, I don't think anything specific in that.\\nRukmini Rao\\nNilanjan, also, in terms of the utilization, whether it's including the trainees or excluding, given\\nthat you are going into a difficult year, is there any sort of a number that you are working with\\nin terms of improving your utilization?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nOf course, as we look, as the year progresses, we will have different targets for, as the quarters\\nprogress. Because you can't put all the freshers into on day one into programs. So, it depends\\non the kind of work that you will have. You will have T&M work, FP work. So, it's literally\\nhorses for courses. Which programs come in, how many freshers can you put in, in large deals,\\nby default you can put in more freshers. So, it's quite complicated.\\nPage 20 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nRukmini Rao\\nBut given that your revenue guidance is not great, that would mean to say that you'll not have\\nas many work, or…?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, that is of course a headwind. So, one of the ways you get around that is on existing deals.\\nSo, if a current project is three years old, you move people out from an existing deal, which is\\nthree years, well into tenure, move up the people into higher roles, put freshers in, and move\\nthose experienced people into other deals. So different ways you can play this game as well.\\nBut yes, of course, I mean, if you don't have those large volumes, there is a bit of a headwind\\nin terms of how much we can deploy.\\nRishi Basu\\nRukmini, thanks. Jochelle had a question. Shilpa, one sec. Jochelle had a question, and after\\nShilpa's, we'll close the conference.\\nJochelle Mendonca\\nSo, it's a broader question. Over the past few months, we have seen companies say that they\\nhave record high deals, strong deal wins, and with Accenture announced 19,000 job cuts, or in\\nthe case of TCS, say, the market is still uncertain, and have issues with not as strong growth as\\nmaybe the market had expected. Could you give some color on why there may be this\\ndisconnect between strong demand and high deals, and good deal wins and large deals, that's\\nnot somehow flowing into the revenue line?\\nSalil Parekh\\nJochelle, it'll be difficult for me to comment on those two companies.\\nJochelle Mendonca\\nNo, I mean a broader industry thing, because I think, you have had good deal wins this quarter.\\nIt's not terrible deal wins for Infosys.\\nPage 21 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nSalil Parekh\\nFor us, I think, for Infosys, we have had very strong year in terms of wins, $9.8 bn, and that is\\nwhat we see the growth guidance that we have given, 4% to 7%. Then we saw in the quarter\\nsome of the ramp-down. So, there is always some additions, and then this what we had not seen\\nat the end of last quarter, those ramp-down. So, then we balance those two things as we give\\nthe guidance.\\nJochelle Mendonca\\nSlowdown is so bad that it's offsetting the remarkable deal wins we saw in the quarter?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThere, the way we look at it is, we had very good large deal wins. And then we had some clients\\nwhere we had ramp-downs.\\nRishi Basu\\nShilpa, you had a question?\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nYes. The revenue productivity has dropped sharply. And that too, it’s on a consolidated basis\\nwith all the subsidiaries added. It’s $53,400 vis-à-vis, $57,000, nearly $58,000 last year. So, if\\nyou can help us understand that – revenue productivity per employee?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo, this is just your total revenue by headcount. And in a way, our utilization, if it's down from\\n88% to 80%, straightaway, mathematically, you have a 10% reduction. So, that's just the impact\\nof utilization. So, we are just carrying many more freshers than we did last year. That is as\\nsimple as that.\\nShilpa Phadnis\\n\\nPage 22 of 23\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Infosys Limited\\nApril 13, 2023\\n\\nAnd in terms of the renewals, are clients taking longer than usual to renew? And hence, the\\nrevenue recognition hasn't happened. Is that one of the reasons why you see more slower\\nclosures?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThere, what we are seeing is in a large deal pipeline, we have seen an expansion in the time to\\nclose a deal. So, it's not specific to a renewal or to something new. It's more that in the large\\ndeal pipeline, we have seen that.

And thank you for joining this call.\\nFY ‘23 was a year of two halves, mirroring broader macroeconomic conditions. Growth\\nwas extremely strong in H1 with 20%, year-on-year constant currency which reduced\\nto 11.2% in H2 due to the slowdown in verticals like telecom, high-tech, retail, and\\nparts of financial services. Q4 came in slower than expected due to some specific client\\nramp-downs in discretionary spend and delayed client decision-making on new deals.\\nIn addition, we had some one-off revenue impacts, including project cancellations, etc.\\nDespite the above, we closed FY ‘23 with a strong 15.4% growth in constant currency,\\nleading to continued market share gains.\\nOperating margins for Q4 and FY ‘23 were at 21% in line with our guidance. Free cash\\nconversion to net profit for FY ‘23 was near 85%. FY ’23 EPS grew by 1.3% in dollar\\nand 9.7% in rupee terms.\\nClient metrics were strong with the number of $50 mn clients increasing to 75, $100\\nmn client counts increasing to 40, and $200 mn client counts increasing to 15.\\nLTM voluntary attrition declined to 20.9%.

              "  'Coming to Q4 performance, revenues grew by 8.8% year-on-year and declined by 3.2%\\nsequentially in constant currency terms due to the reasons mentioned earlier.\\nUtilization declined to 80% on the back of softness in demand. We expect the utilization\\nto improve gradually in the coming quarters as freshers starts getting deployed.\\nWe will calibrate the hiring for FY’24 based on available pool of employees, growth\\nexpectations and attrition trends.\\nQ4 margins were at 21%, which is a decline of 50 basis points sequentially.

Five large deals were in manufacturing, four in FS, three in CRL,\\ntwo each in Life Sciences and Hi-Tech, and one in EURS.\\nRegion-wise, this was split by ten in America and seven in Europe.\\nIn FY ‘24, we signed 95 large deals with TCV of $9.8 bn with 40% net new.\\nComing to vertical segment performance,\\nFinancial services vertical was impacted by budgeting delays at the start of the year led\\nby macroeconomic uncertainty coupled with softness in mortgages, asset management\\nand investment banking.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-andanswer session. Our first question is from the line of Yogesh Aggarwal from HSBC.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nYogesh Aggarwal\\nYes, hi, good evening, couple of questions. Firstly, while the quarter was weak, the\\nguidance at the upper end still looks very solid when we just mathematically look at the\\nsequential build up from here. So, is that 7% based on some macro pickup or is it what\\nyou see today 7% is possible? And related to that, Salil, in general, the demand and the\\ngrowth picked up post-COVID. So are we back to pre-COVID growth rate of 5%, 6%,\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"7% or FY '24 is one-off? And we can see a pickup from FY '25. And then I have a\\nfollow-up, please.\\nSalil Parekh\\nHi, Yogesh, this is Salil. I didn't catch the second one. I'll go with the first question,\\nthen you can just repeat the second one. On the guidance, what we have built it with\\ntoday is, what we see with the deals we have sold and the ongoing work that we have\\nand then put the range between 4% and 7%. There are different scenarios in which\\ndifferent things happen. We have widened the band to three points given the uncertainty\\nin the environment. We also have a very strong large deal pipeline with some mega\\ndeals in the pipeline. Of course, these are always binary. But given the strength of the\\npipeline, we believe that there is, ways that we can achieve the high end of the band of\\nguidance.\\nYogesh Aggarwal\\nGot it. So, I was asking, the second question was 4% to 7% is almost going back to preCOVID growth rate. So, is it like the new normal again or we can expect some pick up\\nagain from FY '25? That is one. And also, Salil, I wanted to ask you on the recent\\nmanagement exits. Just recently, you had two Presidents and COO. Now all three are\\nnot there for whatever reasons. So, has it impacted the business by any chance? And\\nwhat is the new structure? Are you going to replace them or is it in, the new structure\\ndoesn't need Presidents and COO.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on the first one, as of course, we don't provide a view or a guidance beyond this\\nfinancial year. Underlying the way we see the business, we see two growth drivers. And\\nwe are well positioned on both in terms of capabilities and track record. One is on digital\\ntransformation, comprising of cloud and other elements and one is on cost efficiency,\\nautomation and an additional element, which is on consolidation that comes in through\\nthat.\\nWe see both of those drivers working. We have seen a reduction in the digital\\ntransformation work today. We see more in the cost and efficiency and consolidation\\nplay today. But going through and depending on where the client is, what the\\nenvironment is, we feel comfortable for both of those drivers to work over time.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"In terms of the structure, we have put in place a structure for the delivery organization,\\nwhich is already rolled out. And in the next few weeks, we'll roll out the new structure\\nfor our FS team. So, we feel good with the leadership pool that we have within the\\ncompany, who are moving up to take a broader role and a larger role, and that they will\\nstep up and deliver what we are driving to.\\nYogesh Aggarwal\\nVery helpful. Thank you so much Salil.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen.\\nBryan Bergin\\nHi. Good evening. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the growth outlook first. At the\\nmidpoint of your 4% to 7% range, can you give us a sense on how much of the backlog\\nis already in hand versus having to go out and convert upon the pipeline to achieve that\\ngrowth target? And does the amount that you have to sign in that pipeline to hit the\\ntarget differ relative to prior years at this time?\\nSalil Parekh\\nHi, this is Salil. Thanks for that. We don't have a specific number there that we share\\nexternally. What I can share is, we see through this past financial year, we have had a\\ngood, large deals booking, $9.8 bn with 40% net new and we see a set of very strong\\nactive relationships, some of them are expanding through the year through other work.\\nAnd then we saw in Q4 during the quarter, some ramp downs. So, keeping those factors\\nin mind, we have built the guidance of 4% to 7%. And we see that we have the ability\\nto deliver on that guidance.\\nBryan Bergin\\nOkay. And my follow-up is kind of on margins here. So, you've cited internal efficiency\\nprograms that you are going to progress upon, I think, pyramid, office consolidation\\nand other items. Is there a stated target of cost reduction that you are expecting to\\nachieve? So, a run rate of operating margin expansion? Just trying to get a sense of how\\nyou think about the structural margins of the business, assuming the efficiency\\ninitiatives you’ve cited?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Salil Parekh\\nSo, there, we put together an internal plan with targets and, a road map for each of the\\nsubcategories that we outlined and a few others. And we have a view to drive that\\nthrough the next period here in the coming quarters. We have not shared that target\\nexternally, but our view is to make sure that we put in place, execute on that programs\\nin place and deliver to that in the medium term.\\nBryan Bergin\\nThank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JPMorgan. Please\\ngo ahead.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nHello, Thank you. The first question is on, I just wanted to get a bit more color, if you\\ncan, on the reasons for the very sharpness on revenues and margins versus the guidance.\\nWhy did it surprise you? And how much of the demand environment has existed\\nthrough the quarter or versus what probably came in the last 30 days? That is the first\\none.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, what we saw there was during the quarter, as the quarter progressed, we saw some\\nclients ramped downs on programs. And this was across different sectors- Telecom,\\nRetail, Hi-Tech and parts of Financial Services- mortgages, investment banking, asset\\nmanagement. And that was something which were unplanned as we went through. And\\nthen additionally, we had some one-time impact, which we saw in the quarter as well.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nWould you be able to elaborate on the one-time impact, Salil?\\nNilanjan Roy\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Yes, so I think firstly, the majority of the decline is volume-led. The balance of the\\nrevenue is one-timers which is a combination of specific client issues including the\\nimpact of cancellations as well, which is just a top line impact, more and more over and\\nabove the volume impact. So that is the state of play, really for the quarter.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nOkay thank you. On the guidance, I just wanted to get a sense, looking at what happened\\nin the quarter and the uncertainty in the environment, are you turning more conservative\\nfor the guidance setting process for FY24 both on the revenues and the margins versus\\nwhat you may have done before? And also along with that, if you can share what is the\\nvisibility that you have at the moment for the full year versus what you may have had\\nat the beginning of last year?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there on the guidance, we took into account what we see typically as we close the\\nyear in March on what we have had in new large deals and overall new deals. And the\\nongoing work that we have across our client base. And that basically becomes the\\nfoundation of our guidance. Typically, again, as you know well, we don't have a\\ndetailed view of Q3 and Q4. So, we have more typically estimates from other years that\\nwe use. And that is the same approach we have used this year from what we see as we\\nlook out. And the same on margin we finished the year at 21%.Utilization in Q4 is low\\ncompared to what we want to target. We have a very strong efficiency and cost program\\nbut within that program we are very clear that from an employee perspective we will\\ncontinue with our commitment with employees. And so, the utilization will go up\\nthrough the quarters but in the medium term, we will get that impact back into the\\nmargin and that is how we build the ‘20 to ‘22 margin guidance.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nUnderstood. Just a last question on the leadership, I think this was attempted before,\\nclearly there has been departures as you know/ acknowledge. And some of them have\\ngone to competition, probably will drive hungrier peers going forward. Do you think\\nyou are losing muscle and increasing the roles and responsibilities at a more\\nconcentrated leadership team? At least I've seen this from the outside, at a time when\\nthe industry is facing a tougher period this year?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Salil Parekh\\nSorry Ankur, I didn't follow you. You said, will we have concentrated leadership or?\\nAnkur Rudra\\nYes, the concentrated leadership and basically more roles and responsibilities. As an\\nexample, on your door or Nilanjan's door versus having three other very senior leaders\\nhelping you with a wider leadership team.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOkay. What we have seen and what we know is within the company, there is a very\\nstrong set of leaders across different roles. On delivery, many of them have now stepped\\nup. And clearly any role as you start to step up to delivery and leadership within a large\\ncompany like Infosys becomes more concentrated. And that has been announced and\\nrolled out and the same will happen with FS where we are rolling that out in the coming\\nweeks. FS segment of course, is a large segment for us. So those will be concentrated\\nin that sense. So we will have a leadership structure with a very strong responsibility\\nfor several of the senior leaders.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nUnderstood. Thank you and best of luck.\\nModerator\\nThank you, our next question is from the line of Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak. Please\\ngo ahead.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nYes, hi. I have a couple of questions. The first question is on the guidance once again.\\nIs it back ended or guidance that you've seen with growth through the course of the\\nyear? And related question to the guidance is that given the deterioration in the macro\\nenvironment along with the huge miss in the 4Q, along with weak signings do you think\\nyou have been watchful in your guidance for FY ‘24? You know, has the process been\\ntightened. Any thoughts on that would be welcome?\\nSalil Parekh\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Hi, Kawal. This is Salil, on the revenue growth guidance, the thinking is really spread\\nover the four quarters. I'm not sure I would say it is front or back but it is based on what\\nwe see in the large deals today. And also, in the pipeline that we have, where we do\\nhave some mega deals in the pipeline. So, that gives some weightage to the guidance\\ngiven where those deals will come in the, later on in the year itself. The second one,\\nsorry, Kawal was, are we more conservative? Is that the point?\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nNo, has the process of guidance have been tightened, or rather the forecasting process\\nhas it been tightened given the magnitude of miss in your revenues in the quarter, which\\nobviously would have shocked you as well. You know, have you basically built-in\\nbetter cushion, greater cushion in your guidance for FY ‘24? Or is the process and the\\nunderlying assumptions the way it used to be historically?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo we have tried to put in place what is changing or changing and uncertain economic\\nenvironment which where we saw some of these impacts. So, those factors have been\\ntaken in as we build this guidance.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nOkay and the second question that I had is on profitability. You know every company\\nwould you know I mean want to operate at a certain base level of profitability. Now in\\nInfosys’s case, this profitability has been drifting down and the profitability guidance\\nis down to 20% to 22%, which is a new low. How should one think about the underlying\\noperating assumptions behind these deal wins you know, and the process of bidding for\\nlarge deals? And how does that tail in now with the underlying base of profitability\\naspirations and rather assumption that you have? So how should one think about\\nstructural profitability, if you may?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nHi, Kawal. Yes, so I think if you step back a bit into the last year and a half, I mean,\\nbasically the whole chasing of this demand side, three compensation hikes in 15\\nmonths, stretch salaries- all that in a way has made our structure bit inefficient. And in\\na way, part of that today is the reverse that you are sitting with 80% utilization whereas\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'you want to be at much higher levels and the pyramid is not as efficient because you\\nhad to get talent from anywhere when the market was hot.\\nSo, we have seen a lot of these sort of things during this period where we can identify\\nthese pockets sub-con rising to 11.5%. So, we were clear that we had to go behind\\ngetting the volumes in and we knew we had time to correct the margin structure. And\\ntherefore, that is fundamentally what we still believe in. Our guidance is just today at a\\nmidpoint at the end of the year at 21%. And we have enough flexibility guidance in this\\nbetween 20% to 22% and in-a-way 21% is just a midpoint of that. To take care of firstly\\nof course there may be some headwinds coming because of compensation, there could\\nbe something on travel. But at the same time you have levers of improving our\\nutilization at 80%, really which is probably on the lowest I have seen. We have other\\nopportunities of improving the pyramid, because the higher bench comes with a double\\nwhammy of course. One is you have the ideal cost of the bench and at the same time\\nyou have a very rich pyramid.\\nSo the moment you start moving freshers into the pyramids, you get a double benefit\\nof cost that, the idle cost goes away from the bench and your quality of the pyramid\\nimproves on the production side. So you are sitting on in fact two inefficiencies now.\\nThese are the levers we start using, pricing etc, still going on, maybe conversations,\\nhow we built in COLA (cost of living adjustments). So, our aspiration continues to be\\nthat we continue to look at improving margins from where we are. The guidance is just\\na reflection of the flexibility in this uncertain year and we have ended at 21% as you\\nsaw consistently during the last year as well.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nSorry to interrupt you Nilanjan there, see uncertainty might be there on revenue but on\\ncost, there are only tailwinds and there are a number of tailwinds that you listed out and\\nI presume that the labor market is also cooled off, so why bring down the lower end of\\nthe band actually?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, so I think also some is that many some of these levers will take time to put in\\nbecause it is a different situation of how much room you have to deploy levers when\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"you are growing at 10% versus when you are going at 4% to 7%. So, for instance you\\nhave fresher, how fast can you deploy them, when you are growing at 4% is at a\\ndifferent pace versus what you were deploying at 7% versus what you were deploying\\nat 10%.\\nSo, all that will still weigh into the structure. It is not that you can immediately say, I'm\\ngoing to overnight change my utilization from 80% to 85% or shift the onsite offshore\\nbecause in a way a slower volume regime has that overhang on how fast can we deploy.\\nBut like I said, when we started, that we are sitting on these inefficiencies which are\\nvery visible to us. And we know we can deploy many of these levers which we have to\\ncontinue to aspire for higher margin profiles.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nOkay, got that. Thank you so much.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from CLSA. Please go\\nahead.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\nThanks for the opportunity. Nilanjan just continuing on Kawaljeet's question around\\nmargins, two things. One, what kind of a time frame are you looking at for this year's\\nwage hike? Are you sticking to first quarter? And what kind of a quantum are you\\nexpecting? What kind of a margin impact will you foresee of that? Will it be similar to\\nlast year, or do you think this could be lower this year?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, so this will be continuously evaluated. We have built in, like I mentioned, into our\\nguidance, the compensation. And we will take the decision during the year as we're\\nlooking at the market context, to competitive context, so no decision has been taken as\\nyet.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"So the hike may not happen in the first quarter, is that what you are saying?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nAt this moment, no decision has been taken for the hike.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\nUnderstood. And at the lower end of the guidance, are you keeping a buffer for some\\nkind of a potential pricing pressure that might come in during the course of the year? Is\\nthat the headwind which you see as the major one, when you are guiding for a 20%\\nmargin?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I don't think, specifically on pricing. I think it is just that we are at 21% and the\\nmidpoint between 20% to 22%, just happens to be 21%. And like I said, there may be\\nsome headwinds and maybe some tailwinds. And of course the aspiration will continue\\nto do better than our margins as well. So nothing specific like that in terms of pricing\\ncontingency or something.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\nOkay. And Salil, if I look at the net new deal wins, probably this was the lowest since\\nwe had from the start of the pandemic. I mean, was this mainly due to clients delaying\\ndecisions on deal awards, towards the last 30 days? And are you building any\\nconversion of this to get to that 7% at the upper end of the guidance?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, one of the things we have seen in the pipeline is a slowing in decision making.\\nSo, large deals are staying in the pipeline longer. Having said that, the net new or even\\nthe quantum of large deals as we discussed in the past, there is always volatility. These\\nare only deals over $50 mn and not everything. It is not a full booking value. And so\\nwe have always seen that volatility in the past. We think, it is the large deal pipeline\\nthat we have today, which happens to be a very large pipeline and some mega deals in\\nit. We have the ability to drive to our growth guidance as we run through the year.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Pankaj Kapoor\\nSo just to clarify at an upper end of the guidance, we are expecting some of those mega\\ndeals to convert during the course of the year?\\nSalil Parekh\\nI would not be so specific in that to say what it is based on. We do have a large pipeline\\nwith mega deals and we anticipate that some of those will allow us to get to the higher\\nband of the guidance.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\nUnderstood. Thank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Abhishek Bhandari from Nomura.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nThank you for the opportunity. Salil and Nilanjan, this quarter we had certain\\nunanticipated external events that led us to miss our guidance of 16% to 16.5%.\\nSpecially, after we have upgraded at the end of Q3. Do you think you could have\\nconsidered issuing a profit warning citing results from beyond your control? Because\\nthis time the miss seems to be fairly sudden and shocking in the fourth quarter?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I think when we see the full year, we said 16% and we are at 15.4%. And we said\\n21% margin, and we were at 21% as well. So, I am not sure what are you referencing\\nto.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nNilanjan where I was coming from, we had raised the band at the end of Q3. We\\nsignaled we possibly had better execution under control. Of course, things have\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'changed there a macro situation beyond our control and there were some\\ncancellations. So as a good practice.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nThis evolved during the quarter right. So the situation also has evolved during the\\nquarter, it is not as if suddenly on one day, we wake up and suddenly see that the\\nvolumes are down. This is a situation during the quarter as well.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nOkay. The second question is, Salil, I think in the press conference, you mentioned\\nM&A could be an opportunity, where some of the global companies could consider\\nselling the captives. Do you foresee a meaningful deployment of capital for that\\nparticular purpose this year? Are there enough number of such captive conversations\\nin your pipeline?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on M&A, I think we have, with a strong balance sheet, the ability to do something\\nsmall or medium or large. Today we look at many opportunities. We will see how\\nthose fit in. There are various components to it, a strategic fit, valuations, which are\\nmuch more reasonable today, cultural fit of those companies and the ability for us to\\nintegrate that in and so all of those we will keep in mind. And if it meets those points\\nfor us, we will look at those opportunities.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nThank you, Salil. And all the best.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from AMBIT Capital\\nPrivate Limited. Please go ahead.\\nAshwin Mehta\\nThanks for the opportunity. So Salil, what is the nature of this one-off client issue?\\nAnd when this reverse out like we saw last year in the same quarter, where we took a\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"client contract provision. Secondly, is it a single client or multiple client issue that we\\nare talking about? And in which segment have you seen this client issue? And I have a\\nfollow-up.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So like I said earlier, this is a one-off client revenue issues and there are a\\nnumber of clients. It is a mixture of clients, and some of it is a provision against them.\\nSome may come back, some may not come back and some of it is also linked to\\ncancellations. Because the revenue impact also beyond the volume impact of\\ncancellations. Yes there is a mixture of clients there.\\nAshwin Mehta\\nAnd the 10% decline that we have seen in US Telecom, is it related to this, these client\\nissues because that appears to be a pretty steep decline?\\nNilanjan Roy\\n10% decline in?\\nAshwin Mehta\\nIn the US telecom business of yours?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I don't think anything specific is coming out of these issues really.\\nAshwin Mehta\\nOkay. And the last one is, if I look at your guidance it implies a 2.9% sequential growth\\nover the next four quarters. The last we saw this ex of the COVID surge was in FY '16,\\nso what drives such a high growth comfort for us in an uncertain environment?\\nSalil Parekh\\nCan you repeat please?\\nAshwin Mehta\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"So the CQGR requirement for your top end of guidance is around 2.9% sequential every\\nquarter. This is something that excluding of FY '22, we have seen last in FY '16. So in\\nan uncertain demand environment, what drives such a high-growth comfort?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, what we have seen with our guidance is we have some good large deals that we\\nclosed in the previous financial year. And we have a pipeline, several of them mega\\ndeals which gives us the opportunity to have those come into our mix and give us a\\nflow through the year.\\nAshwin Mehta\\nSo would you say the sub $50 mn deal flow is where the traction is much stronger than\\nwhat appears in the greater than $50 mn deal flow that we announce typically?\\nSalil Parekh\\nWe don't have a view that we share typically on the non-large deals, but our large deals\\nis one of the components that we use to build out the guidance.\\nAshwin Mehta\\nSure Salil, thanks a lot and all the best.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nHi, thanks for taking my question. So first is conversion of the order book to revenue.\\nIf I look at your fiscal '23, you entered the year with a net new deal win of roughly $3.8\\nbn, which generated incremental revenues of $1.9 bn. You are entering fiscal '24 with\\na net new deal wins of $3.9 bn, which is pretty similar to last year, but the guidance\\nimplies incremental revenues of $1 bn at the midpoint. Just trying to understand that\\nwhat has changed that is driving significant downtick in the incremental revenue with\\na very similar net new deal wins in your book.\\nNilanjan Roy\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"So, I think part of it is the net new wins and the phasing of that, right? And I think in\\nFY '22, you would have seen them more throughout the year. And if you are seeing in\\nFY '23, I think the last quarter, for instance somebody has also mentioned has been a\\nweaker quarter because there is usually a four to six-month gap between that deal win\\nright before it comes into revenue. So I think partly is the phasing, but the underlying\\nis I think we have had strong deal wins on both sides and a percentage of net new. I\\nthink part of the answer is the way the net new has phased in during the year.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nSo, it is to do with the ACV growth being weaker than the TCV growth. Is that like a\\nfair understanding?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nCould be, could not be, also a timing of it, right? So I'm just saying that in the net new,\\nlike, for instance, in quarter 4, is about 21%. So that will reflect in FY '24 going forward\\ninitially. And then, of course, as new deals ramp up, that is a separate volume impact.\\nBut the phasing of the wins within that is also to be seen, where the net new has come.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nAll right. The second question is around the comment that you made around the\\nstabilization that you have seen in March. So, is it fair to say that your guidance is\\nassuming things are likely to improve sequentially from here on? And this is the worst?\\nOr it is difficult to say that the worse is behind us?\\nSalil Parekh\\nAt this stage we are not seeing any of those things. What we are saying is we saw some\\nstabilization, but the environment is uncertain. So, we are watchful and agile. And one\\nof the reasons we have expanded the growth guidance band to three percentage points\\nis to take that into account.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nGot it. Last question from me on the margins. So how much of the margin downtick is\\nprimarily a cost-led issue, which will rectify over a period of time? And how much it is\\nkind of flexibility you have given to yourself to go after the deals, which may have a\\nfundamental different contract profitability?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Nilanjan Roy\\nLike I said we explained how we have done the margin guidance. We ended at 21%.\\nThat is the midpoint of 20% to 22%. We have some headwinds. We have some\\ntailwinds. And this margin allows us that flexibility as well. Of course, we continue to\\naspire to improve that.\\nModerator\\nThank you. We'll take a next question from the line of Sudheer Guntupalli from Kotak\\nMahindra Asset Management. Please go ahead.\\nSudheer Guntupalli\\nHi good evening, thanks for the opportunity. A couple of clarifications. Due to\\nunplanned ramp-downs and cancellations, you said we have seen a sharp 3.2% fall in\\nthe revenue. However, margins fell just 50 basis points. And even based on the\\npositioning of margins you gave, utilization and cancellation led impact isn't so much\\nin proportion to 3.2% fall in revenue.\\nLogically, this decline of this magnitude should have entailed a much bigger margin\\nimpact, given the cost recalibration is difficult in the near term. So just curious, is there\\nany sizable pass-through element which would have gotten rolled off, which would\\nhave also led to the revenue decline? Or is there any deferred cost component, which\\nwill come and hit us in the subsequent quarters?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nAs we went through the margin walk earlier, if you go back to our script, we have\\nexplained the four key elements. I think they are quite clear of how the margin has\\nmoved from 21.5% to 21%.\\nSudheer Guntupalli\\nSure. And the second part, the reason why I'm also asking about this pass-through\\ncomponent is the SVB scare and the sentiment overhang sort of unfolded from 10th\\nMarch, post which there were 12 to 15 working days. And the revenue was almost 3.5%\\nto 4% short of guidance or expectations, which means there is a $180 mn revenue\\nswing. It looks quite a bit for 12 to 15 working days of invoicing, so again to put it\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'conversely, is there a deferred revenue component, which can come in the subsequent\\nquarters since you also mentioned somewhere about the provision reversal or one off?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I am not clear on your question really.\\nSudheer Guntupalli\\nNo. What I was asking was in general, the macro sentiment overhang unfolded in the\\nlast quarter?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I think if you say that whether all the shortfall of 3.5% has happened in the last,\\nlike month or something like that?\\nSudheer Guntupalli\\nYes. So, you are saying the 3.5% shortfall is evenly spread from the beginning of the\\nquarter itself and not necessarily SVB etc.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, of course the onetime is a different issue, but the majority of the drop in revenue\\nis because of volume. And like Salil said, this was pretty much after 15th and we have\\nactually seen March stabilizing. So it was in the initial half of the quarter.\\nSudheer Guntupalli\\nThanks.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Surendra Goyal from Citigroup. Please\\ngo ahead.\\nSurendra Goyal\\nHi good evening. So my first question was on the revenue guidance. Just wanted to\\nconfirm that the guidance is all organic in nature?\\nSalil Parekh\\nYes, the guidance is all organic.\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Surendra Goyal\\nAnd second question is on margins for Nilanjan. So, while I understand that your\\nguidance is always annual. But how do you really think about medium-term margins,\\nright? So the common question we have been getting from investors, given the direction\\nof margins is can it be 18% a couple of years down the line. So, I know you can't\\nquantify it, but just wanted to understand how you guys think about medium-term\\nmargins?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nWe have explained it earlier in the question to Kawal as well. If you have to step back\\nand you see during this period of COVID, for us to go after in a very talent constrained\\nenvironment, the impact on the cost structure of the company all across- per capita cost\\nwent up, with a combination of compensation stretches, pyramids got skewed,\\nbasically, fundamentally, you were going behind these large deals. We don’t have time\\nto really optimize on all these levers, subcon at a record 11.3%. All these inefficiencies\\nwe saw, but like we have continuously said during that period that we knew that we had\\nto go and grab that volume, and we would have enough time to subsequently as we start\\nunwinding those inefficiencies and this is a cost optimization program we run\\nthroughout That is where we still think these inefficiency still exists across- utilization\\nis a classic one, we're sitting today at 80%, as we mentioned and it is got a double\\nwhammy on cost, like I mentioned earlier. So, these are things we will continue to target\\non and aspire to improve our margins, and 20% to 22% really gives us that flexibility\\nand 21% just happens to be the midpoint where we ended the year.\\nSurendra Goyal\\nSure, I get the annual guidance. My question was more medium-term because in good\\ndemand scenario, margins go down because of supply side issues and in bad demand\\nscenario, possibly, they go down because of either pricing or whatever other reasons.\\nSo maybe, I'll just take it offline.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital.\\nKeith Bachman\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Yes. I had two questions also. Could you talk about what the growth rate of the backlog\\nin the pipeline was during the March quarter and how that differed during the December\\nquarter?

And within that context,\\ncould you give us a sense of you called out there are several onetime events for\\ncustomers. Could you give a quantification about what that was in the quarter?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nWe don't quantify that. But like I said, the majority has been because of volumes and\\nthe balance has been because of the one-timer across clients, some of them related to\\ncancellation and other provisions.\\nKeith Bachman\\nOkay but you don't want to give a characterization of what those cancellations were a\\nquantification of it?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I don't think anything else we have to add on this, Keith.\\nKeith Bachman\\nMy second question then relates to pricing. And the previous question, I think, was\\ntrying to get at this. I'm not sure I understood the answer. But if you think about the\\nguidance that you provided- on the one side, perhaps I would think that you give COLA\\nbenefits associated with your contracts, but a lot of your customers, frankly, are\\nexperiencing the same economic weakness you are and therefore, could negotiate can\\ntougher pricing as we look out over the next 12 months.

So that is something which\\nhas actually stemmed quite a lot. In fact, clients understand that we have to also provide\\nfor our own talent and in this hot talent market to compensate their teams. So that is\\nsomething which we have learned appreciate as well. So that is one part of it.\\nSecond, is the program, which we run on digital pricing where we're going after new\\ndigital deals and this is a combination of how we have changed our pricing model into\\nlinking it, for instance, the new early acquired subsidiaries which have higher pricing,\\nit could be more broad-based pricing, outcome-based pricing. There are new\\ninnovative pricing construct, so that is second.\\nThird is simple hygiene work of having COLA clauses into our MSAs. And of course,\\nhow much you can execute and implement is a different question, but at least with\\nthat and deals going in, at least you have a starting point to negotiate with the client as\\nwell.\\nSo it is all three we look at in terms of existing deals, new deals and renewals and of\\ncourse, you have clients where we are able to push this through great levels, some\\nclients ask for that to be ploughed back into the employee sets. Some clients, it\\ndepends on markets, of course, who are going through their own sort of concerns on\\ntheir environment, it may be more difficult. And therefore, it is literally horses for\\ncourses in which we go literally client by client to see where we can get an\\nimprovement in the underlying RPP realization.\\nKeith Bachman\\nAnd so, what is the underlying assumption associated with the guidance for FY '24?\\nAnd how is that different on what you've experienced\\nNilanjan Roy\\nWe don't break down our guidance into volume and price, if you want to call it that\\nway, it is contracted into the overall guidance.\\nKeith Bachman\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Our next question is from the line of Abhishek Kumar from JM Financial.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nAbhishek Kumar\\nHi, good evening and thanks for taking my question. You've seen some divergence in\\nthe client behavior that we have talked about versus what some of our larger peers\\nhave spoken about. One, we have seen march stabilizing while what we heard\\nyesterday was march actually deteriorated?\\nAnd second, the discretionary spend for peers have actually got deferred and not\\ncanceled, while we have seen certain cancellation in the project. So in that context,\\njust wanted to understand the nature of these projects which are being cancelled, are\\nthese discretionary or there are also vendor consolidation deals\\nSalil Parekh\\nWhat we shared was that some of the projects or programs were stopped in an\\nunplanned way during the course of the quarter. These are not resulting from vendor\\nconsolidation. These are resulting from decisions that the clients have typically made\\non their spends given the environment that they are faced.\\nAbhishek Kumar\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

As we shared through the call, first, for the full year\\nwe had good growth, good margin, good cash collection.

We\\nhave a good guidance on margin. We have put in place even more emphasis on our\\ncost and efficiency plan, which has many components at a detailed level, and we look\\nto see that benefit come through over a multi-year period and aspire to higher\\nmargins.\\nAnd we have an extremely strong pipeline with large deals and some mega deals,\\nespecially on cost efficiency and automation. With that, we feel the business remains\\nin a good position and we have the ability to work through different environments on\\ndigital transformation and on cost efficiency consolidation as the course of the year\\ndevelops.

Good evening and good morning to everyone on the call. Thank you\\nfor joining us.\\nWe are delighted to share with you that our Q3 performance was strong with year-onyear growth of 13.7% and quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.4%. This performance was in\\na seasonally weak quarter for us and amid a changing global economy. We continue to\\ngain market share.\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Growth in Q3 was broad-based, with most industries and geographies growing in\\ndouble digits in constant currency. Growth in constant currency for nine months of\\nFY23 was 17.8% compared to the same period of FY22. Our large deal value was $3.3\\nbn, the highest in eight quarters. With 32 large deals, this is the largest number of large\\ndeals in our history, 36% of this is net new. Our pipeline of large deals remain strong.\\nOur digital revenue grew at 22% in the quarter in constant currency and are now close\\nto 63% of our overall revenue. Our core services revenue grew at 2.4%. We are seeing\\ngrowth in both areas of our business, digital and core services. This is a testament to\\nour industry-leading digital capabilities, including our Cobalt Cloud capability and our\\nindustry-leading automation capabilities, both of which are resonating with our clients.\\nOur large deal pipeline is seeing increased traction for automation and cost efficiency\\nprograms. Our results reflect our deep-rooted client relationships, coupled with clientcentric strategy, differentiated digital and cloud capabilities, strength in automation and\\nthe ability to pivot our business rapidly to changing client needs.\\nOur cloud revenues continue to have healthy growth this quarter. Our clients are\\nfocused on accelerating the digital and cloud transformation, both to grow and to\\nbecome operationally more efficient. They trust us to partner with them through the\\ncomplexity of managing this change because of our differentiated capabilities. Our\\nindustry-leading cloud offering, Cobalt, is playing a key role in helping them navigate\\nthe digital transformation.\\nTwo examples of this,\\n-\\n\\nCobalt is helping accelerate business growth and resilience for a large telco and\\nmaking their decision-making more data driven.\\n\\n-\\n\\nWe are supporting a leading aerospace company by automation of their customer\\nexperience area, leveraging a modernized technology infrastructure, driving\\nmaterial cost efficiency.\\n\\nStrong growth was accompanied by stable operating margin at 21.5%.

The\\nsigns around us, around the slowing global economy are visible. Some areas such as\\nmortgages and investment banking and financial services industry, telco, high-tech and\\nretail are more impacted and that is leading to delays in decision-making and\\nuncertainty in spending in these areas. We are confident that the strength of our digital\\nand cloud capabilities and our automation capabilities will continue to position us well\\nin the market.

Let me start\\nby wishing everyone a very happy and safe 2023.\\nQ3 was another quarter of resilient performance. Our revenue grew by 13.7% year-onyear and 2.4% sequentially in constant currency terms, despite seasonal weakness.

In the meanwhile, we will move to our next\\nquestion, that is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please go ahead.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nYes. Hi, good evening and thank you for the opportunity. My question was around the\\nincrease in cost of software packages, that is up by almost $69 mn sequentially. How\\nshould we think of this cost, do you think this incremental $69 mn will be a sticky\\nnumber out there or do you think it’s sort of representing the headwind -- instead come-\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'off going forward? And is this sort of a pass-through in nature, that is the second sort\\nof clarification on the same thing? Thank you.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, Nitin. So the $69 mn is a combination of software, it is other deals which we do\\nwhich have DaaS etcetera. It could be infrastructure. So, these are part of our integrated\\nservices offering. These come with both manpower component and sometimes they also\\ncome with an attachment of these services. So that is the way we do it. It’s an integral\\npart of our service offering.\\nWe have to see where we end up for Q4, but I think, this is part of our overall offering\\nand it is actually giving us traction in the market in many of our service lines.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nSure. So it is a pass-through in nature in a way, is that correct? And basically, at least\\nearlier in the past, we have suggested that the new level would sort of sustain. So, in\\nthe new operating model, this is sort of sticky thing that continues, is that assessment\\nfair – longer time?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nLike I said this is integrated with our services offering, so they are not just standalone\\ndeals we do, they come with the service element as well. So that is the way you have to\\nlook at these deals.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nSure, fair enough. Thank you so much and all the best.\\nModerator\\nThank you.

              "  'Hi, good evening. Thank you. Why don’t you just clarify some comments around\\ndemand? I am curious, if you would say there is a material change in the way that clients\\nare behaving now versus three months ago, in your reported 2Q, because the areas you\\nare citing weakness, I think were the same ones, the pockets of weakness that you talked\\nabout. I am really just trying to understand if you think there has been a real change to\\nspending and contracting there or more broadly the same?\\nSalil Parekh\\nHi, thanks for the question. What we are seeing today, in addition to what we said last\\nquarter, for example in financial services beyond mortgages, we see the investment\\nbanking side of our clients as well are showing an impact of the economic environment;\\nand they are in telco, hi-tech and retail, in some clients. So, we do not see a material\\nchange, but there are within financial services one more area that we see some of the\\nimpact coming in.\\nHaving said that, we have, for example clients in energy or utilities or manufacturing,\\nthose industries are still looking quite strong in terms of their outlook.\\nBryan Bergin\\nOkay, that is helpful. And then on the large deals, the renewals were a big component\\nof that TCV and you have also cited benefits from consolidation in the commentary,\\nare you taking any different approach as it relates to proactive renewals to try to drive\\nmore vendor consolidation opportunities?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSome large deals, as you pointed out, we have had a very strong result, $3.3 bn and 32\\ndeals. We see the focus which we had on transformation continue. But outside of the\\nindustries that we discussed before, where there is some impact, we see huge cost\\nautomation, cost efficiency plays across all industry segments. And there, we have, we\\nbelieve, very strong capability, which is helping us. And within all of those discussions,\\nwe see areas where there is vendor consolidation. The approach we have put in place is\\nsimilar to what we have had in the past. However, we see, given our market share gain\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"over the last several quarters, many clients are looking at us, when they start to narrow\\nthe list in their vendor consolidation.\\nBryan Bergin\\nOkay. Thank you very much.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nApurva Prasad\\nGood evening. Thank you for taking my question. Salil, I'm not asking for any guidance\\nfor '24 or ahead, but would appreciate your comments. And generally, the visibility that\\nyou have for the year ahead, so how different would it be versus typically this time of\\nthe year? So perhaps any comments on pipeline or pipeline-to-TCV conversion?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks for the question. I think, as you rightly said, we are not in a position to provide\\nthe guidance for the year, which starts in April. Pipeline, we have a very strong large\\ndeals pipeline. So we are feeling good that the pipeline is at a level which is in good\\nshape. We see good traction of large deals, and we have seen more-and-more relevance,\\nconnect with our clients on the cost efficiency and automation plays and in the areas,\\nin the industries where there is economics support, a good traction of Cobalt and the\\ndigital transformation plays. So the pipeline is looking quite good today, based on what\\nwe see in the deals flow.\\nApurva Prasad\\nGot it. And Salil, we called out IB, mortgage and parts of telecom, hi-tech and retail, is\\nthere any vertical trend for deals between transformation, the ones that are\\ntransformation in nature and deals that are more on the cost optimization across\\nverticals?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"And the second part to that is, do you see any moderation in new client acquisition\\nchannel with more vendor consolidation deals happening? This was something which\\nhad very strong traction more recently.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the first part, we see some of the growth transformation plays impacted in those\\nindustries that we talked about, for example, mortgage, investment banking, retail, hitech, etcetera. The cost efficiency plays everywhere. So we see that even in programs\\nlet's say, in the energy sector or manufacturing. There, and in many places, we see\\nessentially clients looking to use the cost efficiency to fund the transformation because\\nin many cases, they still need to drive digital or cloud transformation to keep their\\nmarket growth or their client connect, customer connect going. So that is how we see\\nthat play right now.\\nApurva Prasad\\nAnd Salil, on the other part on the new client acquisition, with more vendor\\nconsolidation rates.\\nSalil Parekh\\nYes, there on new clients, we have seen -- while we don't disclose the number, we have\\nseen a very good new client acquisition in Q3. And on vendor consolidation -- there's\\nno contradiction in there to at least -- both are carrying on within our sales expansion,\\nnew client acquisition continues to be important as well. What we are seeing is on\\nseveral discussions, clients are looking, especially if they have six or seven vendors,\\nthey want to narrow it down to one or two or three, and we are appearing to be\\nbeneficiaries in quite a few of those discussions.\\nApurva Prasad\\nGot it. Thank you and all the best.\\nSalil Parekh\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Moderator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal Oswal\\nFinancial Services. Please go ahead.\\nMukul Garg\\nSure. So Salil, I have two questions. First, on the strong TCV wins this quarter. Can\\nyou at least qualify how much of the strength was on account of share gains, which you\\nguys have made, versus the resilience, which is there on the technology spend? Because\\nif you look at the broader market commentary, and you have also highlighted retail as\\none of the weaker areas, whereas you got seven large deals in retail. So if you can just\\nhelp us break out these two, to get a sense of the deals win momentum?\\nSalil Parekh\\nI think the large deal momentum for us is really a function of what we have seen that\\nwe have put in place, we still, within this mix of $3.3 bn, have digital transformation\\ndeal, and we have cost efficiency automation deals. What we mean by some of the\\nindustry callouts, for example, retail or telco, is, there are some clients, it is not everyone\\nin that industry, but there are some clients which are getting impacted by the economic\\nenvironment. We have been quite focused, we have a broader portfolio. So for example,\\nyou saw that in retail, we have those large deals there, it is a mix between transformation\\nand cost efficiency automation. And so many times when clients feel an impact of the\\neconomic environment, there might be a greater need for the cost efficiency play as\\nwell. So we are ensuring that both of those engines continue to work well with our\\nclients.\\nMukul Garg\\nRight. And another question was on the margin side. You guided for margins of 21%22% band, with margins towards the lower end. Can you just help us with the -- what\\nare the pools which you are seeing on profitability, given that the supply scenario is\\neasing rapidly? Is there some portion of the pressure which is on account of the higher\\nshare of cost efficiency deals, which you guys are winning with initial ramp-up cost?\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Because if you look at Q4, obviously, Q3 also had the pass-through business, which got\\nimpacted. I'm assuming, as Nilanjan mentioned, there was some seasonality into that.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So I think like we mentioned, the reason for Q3 margins, we have already given\\nthe breakdown. So as we look ahead, see the levers which we have, one is, utilization.\\nAnd you have seen at 81.7% - this is probably, I think, one of the lowest in the last three\\nto four years since I've been here. So that is one lever which we will have.\\nAnd as we start putting these freshers onto the production floor, you will automatically\\nget a pyramid benefit. So that will be a double value benefit for us.\\nWe also have subcons today, we have dramatically reduced our subcons literally in\\nthree quarters. We were 11% plus, we are at 8.7%. Historically, we have been at 7%. If\\nyou look at our pricing, it has been quite stable. And historically, this is one lever which\\nalways used to drag down, repeatedly, due to discounts on renewals, et cetera. And as\\nof now, we have not seen that at all. We continue to push with clients on where all we\\ncan get price increases.\\nAutomation – in terms of our own workforce continuing to operate that and that is a\\nsteady lever which we have. So we are continuing to use these levers as we look ahead,\\nand we will continue to deploy them.\\nMukul Garg\\nRight. So, is it fair to assume that we should see at least better profitability in the next\\nquarter, given that we have a number of levers with us?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo we have given a guidance for the year. You have seen in the first nine months, and\\nthat should give a good indication of what could Q4 be.\\nMukul Garg\\nFair enough. Thanks for taking my question.

Thanks for the opportunity and congrats on a good quarter.\\nSalil, during some of the previous macro uncertainties like Brexit, within a few weeks\\nof the vote, we had seen some of our large clients canceling and ramping down projects.\\nThis time, even on the tough comps, the pace of growth moderation is much lower than\\nwhat many people have been anticipating.\\nAnd many forward-looking indicators like deal wins, pipeline and CIO surveys still\\ncontinue to be very strong, even 11, 12 months into this macro concerns. So having\\nseen the previous three to four macro downturns, how do you nuance the current cycle,\\nespecially on the variable of the resilience of IT service spends?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, thanks for the question. It's always difficult to compare across cycles. From the\\nperspective of Infosys, my sense is what you mentioned earlier, we are still seeing the\\npace of change when there is change within an industry or a client to be not rapid. And\\nwe are also seeing that the opportunities for cost optimization and efficiency are\\nexpanding within the work that we are doing. So in many ways, we are in a good\\nposition to be able to work on both sides.\\nAnd so while it is difficult to predict what the way the situation in the economy will\\nevolve, we feel quite balanced. Our sales team is quite agile. We have pivoted quite\\nquickly and developed various points of view on different efficiency scenarios in\\ndifferent industries that we feel comfortable that the pipeline is looking good at this\\nstage, and we will continue to work on that.\\nSudheer Guntupalli\\nSure. Thanks Salil. So, is it a right understanding to say that we are now in a much\\nbetter position to navigate this macro weakness, probably through more than enough\\ncompensation from the cost efficiency deal and vendor consolidation deal? Is that a\\ncorrect interpretation?\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Salil Parekh\\nThe way we see it is we have both components of -- at least the two large components\\nthe clients are looking for, we have good industry-leading capability. So it's really a\\nfunction of how a specific industry or subindustry or a client will evolve. But we have\\npositioned ourselves to make sure that we can support our clients in that area.\\nSudheer Guntupalli\\nSure. Thanks Salil. All the best for the future.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nMoshe Katri\\nThank you, and happy New Year, and congrats on strong execution in a pretty tough\\nenvironment. I have a three-part question. First, March guidance upgrades is pretty\\nunusual from a seasonality perspective and given the macro concerns. So it seems like\\nyou have better visibility, now, can you share any views on the budget cycle itself? We\\nwere kind of concerned over slippages, maybe a month or two, budget delays. Are you\\nseeing any of that or you think that budget will be awarded or finalized as on time this\\ntime?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks Moshe. On the budget, so far, we have seen, in some clients and especially in\\nthe industries we have called out, some areas where there has been slowness in deciding\\nor some changes, especially on some discretionary work. So we mentioned hi-tech, for\\nexample or mortgages or bank, investment banking. So all of those ones that we\\nmentioned before.\\nBut we don't see a broad-based change. Equally, we do see good behavior with the\\nbudgets moving ahead as in the past, with energy, utilities, manufacturing. So, it is not\\nlike one answer that it’s a little bit by industry or sub industry somewhat different.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Moshe Katri\\nUnderstood. And then you, in the press conference, you mentioned that about a 1/3 of\\nyour new or 1/3 of TCV came in from new logos. Can you remind us, is this within the\\nrange of what you've seen in the past in terms of mix of new logos versus renewals?\\nSalil Parekh\\nReferring to the large deals, $3.3 bn, there was 36% net new. That is in the range where\\nwe do - some quarters it's lower, some quarters higher, but these numbers are not\\nunusual.\\nMoshe Katri\\nOkay. And then the final question is for Nilanjan. When we met in Bangalore back in\\nDecember, you pointed to pivot in the nature of the new deals flow towards, as you\\nsaid, cost optimizations and vendor consolidation. Obviously, this is what you're seeing.\\nAre these deals typically less dependent on clients' budgets, given the fact that you're\\ntaking over a specific function with the objective of reducing delivery costs? And is\\nthere any difference in profitability levels here in terms of these projects versus some\\nof these projects that you've been doing in the past few years? Thank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo in that, I think the way you described it, these are not fully correlated with the budget\\nof a client. In many instances these are areas where given the evolving economic\\nsituation, clients are looking to reduce their tech spend across the enterprise, in many\\ncases, use some of that savings to fund transformation programs. It sometimes gets\\ncoupled with vendor consolidation. So let’s say – there are clients who may have five\\nor six vendors and when we benefit from the consolidation we see tremendous\\nefficiency that can be created. Our automation tools become quite useful. We typically\\nadd automation on our ongoing programs, which give an annual benefit. But when we\\nsee something of scale where we have not been involved earlier, we have an ability to\\nprovide a much greater benefit. In aggregate, the profitability of these deals is within\\nthe range of the rest of our company and especially has been more-and-more over time\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'leverage the automation tools and our capabilities, we see these becoming stable high\\nprofit deals.\\nMoshe Katri\\nThat is very helpful. Thank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from CLSA. Please go\\nahead.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\nYes. Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. So, my first question is on the smaller deals, which\\nare less than, say, $50 mn TCV. If you can give some qualitative color on how your\\nwin and pipeline in that basket has been moving? Is it higher, lower versus, say, what\\nit was six months back?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks for the question. We don’t typically disclose much about those deals. Overall,\\nwe have a good healthy pipeline while we publicly disclose more about the larger deals.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\nUnderstood. And Salil my second question is on these cost takeout deals. Can you give\\nsome sense on how the pricing in such deals behaving? Are you seeing the pressure\\nthere more than normal, either because clients are pushing for more discounts or\\nbecause of competitive intensity?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, the pricing in Q3, we have seen quite stable within the mix, we have not seen\\na change. Typically, it is really a function of what type of focus that clients have, which\\nindustry they are in, as we have not seen, at least in Q3, in the deals that we have closed\\nin the discussion we have had, a big change on that. It looks stable at this stage.\\nPankaj Kapoor\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Thank you and wish you all the best for ’24.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from J.P. Morgan. Please\\ngo ahead.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nHi, thank you and congratulations on strong headline numbers there. I'm going to try\\nPankaj's question in a different way. You mentioned in previous calls that the mix of\\ndeals was changing in favor of smaller deals. And that is why the headline, TCV was\\ndeclining, but growth was still quite healthy. This time, of course, both have done well.\\nDo you think the mix of deals is still the same as it was in the last year before this\\nquarter?\\nSalil Parekh\\nHi, Ankur this is Salil. I am not clear on the mix of deals on the previous discussions.\\nBut just looking backwards, we see the mix of deals remaining in good shape across\\nthe board. There are some quarters in which there are disproportionate number of\\nlarger-sized deals. But in general, we do not have a pattern in that, at least that is evident\\nin Q3 here.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nOkay. All right. The next question I wanted to check, Salil, again, was on the US\\nbusiness. The headline growth seems to sort of slipped down to close to low double\\ndigits, whereas the Y/Y growth has been led by very strong performance in Europe and\\nmanufacturing.\\nDo you worry about the US business it is sort of slower than Europe it is not the case\\nin the rest of the industry then many of your peers?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, Ankur, our view is, we have had very strong growth in the US at over 10% in\\nQ3 in constant currency. Europe, of course, has been a standout in the growth that we\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"have had. We feel the traction, the pipeline, the work remains pretty strong, as we have\\ndescribed earlier, across the two dimensions, transformation and cost, across the\\ngeographies.\\nIf you look at the economic situation, we do see the European side a little more\\nimpacted, but we see good traction on the pipeline on both sides. We had a very\\nsuccessful Europe program over the last 18, 24 months, and that is also helping us with\\nthe growth in this quarter.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nI mean out of our 32 large deals this quarter, 25 were actually in the Americas. So I\\nthink -- just to, show that we have a very strong pipeline there.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nUnderstood. Maybe a last question over here was on pricing and contract profitability\\nin the projects you are winning right now, especially the large number of big deals this\\ntime you signed. How is that trending? Is that improving, staying the same or maybe\\nbecoming a bit lower than before?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nThese are for the new deal signings?\\nAnkur Rudra\\nYes, new deal signings this quarter. How is that trending versus before?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, I don't think anything is unusual. Yes, absolutely new deals, I mean since many\\nclients want the productivity, efficiencies upfront. So we always see that the initial part\\nof the deals will be lower-than-portfolio margins.\\nBut like we have shown in the past, at the same time, our existing deals are reaching\\nhigher profitability, and that offsets some of this pressure which is coming from the\\nnewly signed deals, where the margins will typically be lower. But nothing unusual on\\nthe trends.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Ankur Rudra\\nOkay. Appreciate it. Thank you for the color and best of luck.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nHello. Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid quarter. So, Salil\\nmy question -- I have just two questions. One, I wanted to basically get an idea on -- I\\nmean you've seen attrition coming down in this quarter quite sharply. And as you\\nmentioned in your opening remarks as well, so how do you see the trend of this attrition\\ngoing forward, of course, downwards? And how do you believe the benefit of this could\\nactually percolate to our margins? Again, not asking for objective guidance of a\\nnumber. But in terms of the direction, do you think it is going to aid our margins? Or\\ndo you think most of the impact of this is already built into the numbers that we have\\ncurrently?\\nAnd my second question was majorly on the geography of Europe. So just wanted to\\npick your brain on how the conversations with the clients are happening in that part of\\ngeography, specifically if you could maybe break up between Continental Europe,\\nEastern Europe and in the UK?\\nAnd which pockets of those geographies do you think are looking more softer? Or is\\nthere more of delayed decision-making in that part of the geography?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nI'll take the first one on the lower attrition. Absolutely, we have seen this coming down.\\nAnd like we said, even in the future in the next quarter, at least until -- what we are\\nseeing the latest initial figures we are seeing this coming down.\\nAbsolutely, this should have a positive impact on margins. I mean, during the year,\\nwhether it was stretched hiring on laterals, whether it was the compensation hikes we\\ndid, that really impacted our year-on-year margin story.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"So as looking ahead in attrition, as an impact both the macroeconomic and also the\\ninternal policies we are doing in terms of promoting within, etcetera, should benefit us.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn Europe, I think the way we see - some 25% of our business in Europe, and we have\\na few countries. In the countries we operate in, we see some slowing, some economic\\nimpact in Germany. There is some in the UK, less so in the Nordic countries at this\\nstage.\\nBut overall, the coloring is a little bit more by the industries that we mentioned earlier\\nin the call, which are across sort of on a global perspective. But relatively, Europe seems\\na little bit more impacted today than certainly the US.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nGot it. If I can just maybe drill down just a little bit more, any specific color that you\\ncan provide on European Retail and European Manufacturing segments?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, we don't necessarily provide that much sort of granularity, same comments on\\na global level on manufacturing that we mentioned earlier and for energy, which is\\nlooking stronger, and more sort of, let's say, attention to the economy on retail in this\\ncase.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nGot it. And the softness in retail, do you believe it is, as of now, confined to the retail\\nstores and maybe percolate, and you could in your discussion with clients, do you see\\npercolating down to the CPG companies and probably other ones as well? But as of\\nnow, if you it is limited to more of the retail stores that we are talking about?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo within retail, we have not called out any specific subsegment, at least in our\\ncommentary. We have not gone down to that granularity in our public statements.\\nVibhor Singhal\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"All right. Got it. Thanks for taking my questions and wish you all the best.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Sameer Dosani from ICICI Prudential\\nAsset Management. Please go ahead.\\nSameer Dosani\\nThanks a lot. Just one question around Europe again. If I look at your commentary\\naround regions in North America versus Europe, Europe looks more cautious overall.\\nBut if I look at performance for the last few quarters, I think Europe has been\\nperforming better than North America as a whole.\\nSo, do you think this impact of the cautiousness is yet to reflect in the numbers and you\\nsee more growth trajectory will be a little more affected, going forward, in your\\nthoughts around that?\\nSalil Parekh\\nI think, in Europe, there is two different things. We have had a very strong Europe\\nprogram, both on transformation and cost over the last 18, 24 months. So, some of that\\ncomes through in the benefits we see, even in this quarter.\\nThe commentary or the view is more to share what we are seeing just in the economic\\nactivity. And again, we see the coloring more by industry, which is a little bit global as,\\nopposed to just specifically across the board in a geography.\\nSameer Dosani\\nSo the outlook -- I mean, do you think the outlook that you're giving will reflect in the\\nnumbers in medium term in the next two quarters because till now, it has been an\\noutperformer versus the overall portfolio? Thanks.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, we have given a view on outlook only up until March this year, so we will\\ncome up with a guidance for the next financial year at the end of this quarter.\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Sameer Dosani\\nOkay and that is it from my side. Thanks.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang Equities.\\nPlease go ahead. Mr. Girish Pai, could you please unmute and go ahead with your\\nquestions? As there is no response from this connection, we will move to our next\\nquestion, that is from the line of Rahul Jain from Dolat Capital. Please go ahead.\\nRahul Jain\\nYes. Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. Firstly, we commented that manufacturing is doing\\nwell for us, but actually the vertical is doing exceedingly well in European region,\\nwhere it is up 60% YoY, but is much weaker in the US, where it is up 7% YoY.\\nSo, what is that we are doing so well in Europe? Is it led by a few very crucial deals?\\nOr it's more holistic? And why it's different in the US?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, thanks for the question. Within the industry, we don't typically comment on a client,\\nmulti-client level activity. But we do have good traction, as you pointed out, within a\\nEuropean business in manufacturing.\\nRahul Jain\\nOkay. And another thing was on digital revenue. For the quarter, it is up 17% YoY or\\nlet say, CC would be 20% or 21%. This is like our slowest ever since we have been\\ngiving this time series on digital revenue. So is this a bit worrying? Or is it more because\\nof the furlough and any other factor?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, it's partially due to some of the changes that we were discussing earlier where\\nin certain industries and sub industries. We see much more attention to the economic\\nenvironment. And there, we see some of the digital or transformation work being\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'slower, where we see much more focus across the board on the cost and automation\\nplays.\\nRahul Jain\\nGot it.

Or the pain remains extended in Q4 as well?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo we will have to see how it goes, it is a bit too early to say what is going to be the Q4\\noutlook on that.\\nRahul Jain\\nOkay. That is it from my side. Thank you so much.\\nModerator\\nOur next question is from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang Securities.\\nGirish Pai\\nYes. Thank you for the opportunity. I just wanted to understand with cost optimization\\ndeals more in the pipeline and in the TCV, has the average deal tenure gone up in the\\nlast couple of quarters?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, thanks for the question. We don’t typically comment on the deal tenure in terms of\\npublic statements.\\nGirish Pai\\nOkay, you said that the third-party items, have given you a lot of traction in terms of\\ngetting deals. Now the number has gone up from about less than 2% of revenue to\\nalmost like -- I think this quarter is -- in this quarter, it comes to almost 6.5% of revenue.\\nDo you see this number going up in the coming quarters and years?\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Nilanjan Roy\\nLike I said, our offering is quite holistic. In some cases, many of the cloud-based deals\\ncome with services, there could be licenses, there could be DaaS. So more and more\\nintegrated deals.\\nAnd then you go to IT as a Service, which is really sort of very holistic, we could see\\nthis. But I mean, it may vary from quarter to quarter, you could have some quarters\\nwhich are up. But there's nothing to say that in the long run where this is going.

My name is Rishi, and on behalf of Infosys, I'd like to\\nwelcome all of you. Over the next hour with our management, we are going to have our\\nfinancial results commentary. We request one question from each media house so that we can\\naccommodate everyone over the next hour. As always, we will start with broadcast media and\\nthen move on to our other friends from media who are present here. With that, let me invite our\\nChief Executive Officer, Mr. Salil Parekh, for his opening remarks. Over to you, Salil.\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks, Rishi. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone who is here on the campus and\\neveryone who is joining us online. We are delighted to share with you that our Q3 performance\\nwas strong, with year-on-year growth of 13.7%, quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.4% – this in a\\nseasonally weak quarter for us and amid a changing global economy.\\nWe continue to take market share. We continue to benefit from consolidation. Growth in Q3\\nwas broad-based, with most industries and geographies growing in double digits in constant\\ncurrency. Our large-deal value was at $3.3 bn, the highest in eight quarters. With 32 large deals,\\nthis is the largest number of large deals in a quarter in our history, 36% of this is net new. Our\\npipeline of large deals remains strong.\\nOur digital revenues grew at 22% in the quarter at constant currency and are now close to 63%\\nof our overall revenue. Our core services revenue grew as well at 2.4%.\\nWe are seeing growth in both areas of our business – digital and core services. This is a\\ntestament to our industry-leading digital capabilities, including our Cobalt cloud capability and\\nour industry-leading automation capabilities, both of which are resonating with our clients.\\nOur large-deals pipeline is seeing increased traction for automation and cost-efficiency\\nprograms. Strong growth was accompanied by stable operating margins at 21.5%. This was\\ndriven by healthy revenue growth and cost optimization benefits. Our voluntary quarterly\\nannualized attrition continues to decline. It was reduced by 6 percentage points sequentially to\\nwell below 20% for this quarter.\\nWhile we are encouraged by the immense confidence and trust our clients have in us, the signs\\naround are showing a slowing global economy. Some areas such as mortgages and investment\\nbanking in the Financial Services industry, Telco, Hi-Tech, and Retail are more impacted, and\\nthat is leading to delays in decision-making and uncertainty in spending in these areas. We are\\nconfident that the strength of our digital and cloud capabilities and our automation capabilities\\nwill continue to position us well in this market. We are keeping a close watch on the global\\neconomy.\\nOur operating model and offerings are agile to deliver value for our clients in this evolving\\nmacro environment. Driven by a growth of 17.8% in constant currency for the first nine months\\nof FY'23 and the strong large-deal value for Q3, we are increasing our revenue growth\\nguidance, which was at 15% to 16%, we are increasing it to 16% to 16.5% for the full financial\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"year, despite the changing global conditions. We are retaining our operating margin guidance\\nfor FY '23 at 21% to 22%. We anticipate to be at the lower end of this range. Thank you.\\nWith that, Rishi, let's open up for questions.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you, Salil. We will open the floor for questions. Joining Salil is Mr. Nilanjan Roy, Chief\\nFinancial Officer, Infosys.\\nWith that, we have the first question from Ritu Singh from CNBC TV18.\\nRitu Singh\\nHi, thank you, you said you have increased your revenue growth guidance despite changing\\nglobal conditions. What gave you this confidence? Why the revision up? What about furloughs,\\nwere they lower than what you were expecting from your comments in the last quarter?\\nAlso, we have seen a significant rupee depreciation during the quarter, and yet the margins\\nhave more or less remained flat. What is the reason for that? And any visibility you have on\\nthe FY'24 growth? Because you are talking about this difficult macro environment and yet you\\nrevised up your guidance. So, what are you hearing from clients in terms of their budgets? And\\nthese large deals that you say continue to be strong in the pipeline, are you seeing more\\nrenewals or newer deals that you expect to win?\\nAnd a word on attrition and hiring as well – do you expect it to continue to trend lower? I think\\nit is the lowest in the last five quarters. And also, hiring is lower than the previous quarter – is\\nit because you are anticipating lower growth? Any comment on that as well?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks for the questions. I will try to get through most of them. On some of the points on\\nmargin, Nilanjan will jump in as well.\\nOn the guidance, our focus is really on what we see as we closed out the quarter. We had\\nexceptionally strong growth QoQ 2.4%, YoY 13.7%, for the first nine months, we are at 17.8%.\\nThen we had very strong large deals. At $3.3 bn, it is the largest we have had in eight quarters.\\nAnd the number of deals is also a testament to the environment for us, at 32 deals, it was very\\nstrong. Given all of those factors, we saw that it was right to increase our guidance.\\nThe point we made also is we do see that there are changes in the economic environment. We\\nhave called out, for example in Financial Services, beyond mortgages, investment banking; we\\nhave called out the Telco sector; we have called out Hi-Tech and Retail. But keeping all that\\nin balance, there were some things that give us a lot of support while we see other factors in\\nthe environment changing. But keeping all that in balance, we were ready to increase our\\nguidance.\\nOn attrition, before we go to the margin and so on, we have seen a steady quarter-on-quarter\\ndecline for the last several quarters. We believe many of the policies we have put in place to\\nmake sure that we are more and more aligned to where our employees are focused on, is\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"helping. And of course, the overall environment is also changing in the market. So, we see\\nattrition continuing to go down.\\nOn FY'24, we have no comments at this stage. We will absolutely look at it at the end of the\\nquarter in Q4. On hiring, we have the number of hiring based on what we saw on the demand,\\nand we have also had a very strong hiring for the full year in FY'23 and also before that. And\\nwe are making sure that all of that hiring goes through our various training and is ready for\\ndeployment.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So, on margins, we are at 21.5%, and that is flat sequentially. A couple of reasons, and\\nfirst you mentioned about the benefits of currency. So, we got a net benefit of about 40 basis\\npoints from currency, net of our hedges. So, that was one tailwind for us. We got another\\nbenefit of about 70 bps from our cost optimization, for instance, our subcon costs, etcetera.\\nAnd from a headwind perspective, there is about 30 basis points additional spend on our\\nSG&A. And the balance, about 80 basis points, was traditional seasonality in the quarter,\\nfurloughs, partly because of our third-party costs. So, these are balance, 80 bps. So that is a\\nbroad walk about a flat 21.5% margin within our guidance, as you know, of 21%- 22%.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Anisha Jain from ET Now. Anisha sends us her\\nquestions on text. Salil, the question for you is, there has been a strong execution and deal\\nwin in Q3 that led to the guidance upgrade as well. Can we extrapolate this to believe that the\\nclient budget will be robust and double-digit revenue growth will sustain in FY'24? And\\ncould you give us a bit more insight on the trends you are witnessing in Europe and for\\nverticals like BFSI and Hi-Tech?\\nAnd Nilanjan, for you, there is a question on margin, which you just answered. A follow-on\\nquestion on attrition that is coming down sharply. Could there be a sharp reversal in margins\\nfrom Q4 onwards? How are the pulls and pushes stacked for margins?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks, Rishi. On the first part, I think we talked a little bit about why the margin was\\nincreased in terms of what we see in the environment. We are not commenting obviously on\\nthe financial year '24 and what the guidance or growth in that year will look like. What we do\\nsee in terms of demand environment is what I shared earlier. We see some areas, for example,\\nthe mortgages area or the investment banking area in financial services, we see some areas in\\nTelco and Hi-Tech and some in Retail.\\nThere is more variation we see in the European markets, more concerns on what is going on\\nwith the economy. The US market is also there, but relatively less so in the US compared to\\nEurope. We will see how this plays out because this is not a scenario where it is the same for\\nevery industry. For example, we have seen extremely strong growth in energy, utilities, that\\npart of our business, and we continue to see that in Q3. We saw very strong growth in\\nmanufacturing, and we continue to see some of that traction in our business in Q3.\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Rishi Basu\\nNilanjan, the question on margin was attrition.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, so absolutely. So one is, of course, as you know, if you have seen our utilization, in fact,\\nthat came as a headwind for us. We have built a large, fresher pipeline. They go through our\\ntraining, like Salil mentioned, at Mysore. And they are on bench now. We are training them,\\nreskilling them. And in fact, that will give us some headroom, for growth looking ahead. So,\\nthe question partly about do we need to hire more, so we have a very substantial bench. And I\\nthink our utilization at about 81.7% is one of the lowest we have had. So, we have some\\nheadroom there.\\nLooking ahead, of course, subcon costs, we have brought them down. At one stage, we used\\nto be closer to 7% of our revenue, we are at around 8.7%; utilization is another factor. We\\ncontinue to work on pricing, onsite-offshore, the pyramid itself, with the freshers coming in\\nwill help us. So, these are the levers, we will have to deploy as we look ahead, in the next few\\nquarters.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you, Nilanjan. The next question is from Sajeet Manghat from BQ Prime. Sajeet has a\\ncouple of questions. For Salil, he wants to know, give us a sense of the demand environment\\nin North America, UK, and Europe. And have you seen a trend of small deal sizes compared\\nto what we saw in the last two years? Do you foresee a slowdown in deal closures?\\nNilanjan, your question is again on margins, which has already been answered. So, I am not\\nasking that again.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the demand environment, similar view. I think we see different demand environment in\\ndifferent industries. And even within some industries, there is a variation based on the client.\\nWe are also seeing much more demand today for automation, cost efficiency, operational\\nimprovement programs.\\nThe size of the deals, as we see with $3.3 bn in large deals, we have a tremendous volume, 32\\nof those deals for this quarter. So we do see a change in the environment. But we see that\\nboth of our engines, the one for digital and cloud driving transformation and the one for\\nautomation driving cost efficiency, both are working and growing for us.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next couple of questions are from ZEE Business, Kushal Gupta, and from\\nHarshada Sawant from CNBC Awaaz. Both are on client and IT budget spending, which we\\nhave already answered. I will ask one question. What is the sense you are getting from your\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"clients in terms of future pricing of deals? How concerned are you about Europe and what\\nimpact could it have on deal flows ahead?\\nSalil Parekh\\nPricing, maybe Nilanjan will take. I will take the question on Europe.\\nEurope, I think we mentioned earlier that there are differences within the European\\neconomies. We are seeing today more economic changes in the European market relative to\\nUS. But even so, there is a factor of the industry. We are seeing good traction in some\\nindustries, for example, energy utilities, and that is across geography, while we see some\\nconstraints which are in Hi-Tech and parts of Financial Services.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nOn the pricing side I think, we have seen a much more stable pricing regime than what we\\nhave seen historically. And part of that has been the high inflation we have seen in these\\neconomies as well and also because of the compensation hike. So some of that, we are trying\\nto work with our clients to pass that on, and we have had some successes there.\\nOf course, things like discounts have actually come down over the years. So, I think this is a\\ndiscussion we have by each client, and I think that is something which we will continue to\\nwork on irrespective for the year ahead.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Reuters News from Nandan Mandayam.\\nNandan Mandayam\\nI just want to know, how long do you expect the softness in BFSI to persist in the US? And\\nalso, if you could give us an insight into how you maintain around the same growth in\\nEurope. And lastly, could you give us an insight into what FY'24 hiring is going to look like,\\nboth in the fresher and lateral terms? Is it going to exceed what we have seen in FY'23 so far?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on the BFSI, I think we do not have a definitive number in terms of when things are\\ngoing to look different. Again, we see differences. There are parts of it, for example,\\nmortgages and investment banking, where we are seeing some constraints on what they are\\ndoing with their business. There are other parts of Financial Services, which are not seeing\\nthose same constraints. We have places, where because of consolidation of partners, we are\\nactually seeing some growth across some clients as well.\\nIn terms of hiring, we have no comment today on our plans for FY'24. Those things, in any\\ncase, we will not comment on the hiring number. We will, at the end of the quarter, lay out\\nthe guidance for growth and margin for next year.\\nNandan Mandayam\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Inaudible question\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn Europe, I think we are fortunate to see a very strong growth. We have had a good focus\\non that geography for the past several years, and we continue to see traction from some of the\\nwork and programs that we have started a while ago.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from The New Indian Express, Uma Kannan.\\nUma Kannan\\nCongrats on a strong quarter. So, do you expect client spending to come down in Q4 and\\nwhether this includes reduction in workforce? And also, one more on automation that you\\nspoke about just now. So Infosys has good capabilities on automation, AI, ML, how are you\\nlooking at this AI chat bot as you have invested in OpenAI also? So what will be the future or\\nhow does the future look like in AI? And how this will actually help in servicing your clients\\nbetter?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo I think the first part of the question was more on what we see the client spend in Q4. I\\nthink our sense is the points that we have laid out with respect to different industries and\\ndifferent clients is what we are seeing right now in Q4. What we see going ahead, we will\\ndescribe for the financial year '24 as we come to the close of this year.\\nIn terms of automation, we made tremendous progress, and that is one of the reasons, because\\nwe have used artificial intelligence, machine learning, we have benefited from clients' needs\\nto be more efficient with their technology spend. And we have been at the forefront of what is\\ngoing on with automation. And that is really the reason why we see both our digital business\\nand our core services business growing.\\nOn OpenAI, several years ago, Infosys had supported this initiative in a very small way\\nthrough a donation. We see the progress they have made. Huge congratulations to what they\\nhave done. We have examples where we are using ChatGPT with client situations, that is\\nstarting to further increase productivity and automation.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Haripriya Suresh from Moneycontrol.\\nHaripriya Suresh\\nHi, good evening. I have one follow-up on ChatGPT. Just wanted to understand if Infosys at\\nsome point – I know OpenAI has since shifted from nonprofit to for-profit – will Infosys look\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"at putting more money? And how do you think it will impact coding and service delivery as\\nwell?\\nAnother question is you had a very strong quarter, but do you think we will go back to a\\nsingle-digit growth? And Nilanjan, just wanted to ask, last quarter, you had mentioned that in\\nH1 FY'23, you had hired 40,000 freshers. 50,000 was the target for this year. How many\\nfreshers were hired in Q3? And has that target been revised? Thank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the first one, I think we have a huge focus and commitment through the past several years\\non automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning. We have no plans today which relate\\nto anything in terms of an investment in any activity. But we are looking at the way to really\\nwork with and partner with, and there are many technologies which enable a way to do lowcode/no-code enhancement or efficiency of building code faster. So we are working with\\nseveral of them to make sure that we work with our clients on it.\\nHaripriya Suresh\\nIn terms of growth?\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn growth, we do not have a guidance for FY'24 at this stage. What we have is really the\\nfocus on Q4 and for FY'23.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. On the freshers, I think the 50,000, we are short of that now, but I think we should be\\naround that number by the time we end the year. So, we have continued to hire. Yes, I think\\nabout 46,000 we have done, if I am not mistaken.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Veena Mani from The Times of India.\\nVeena Mani\\nGood evening gentlemen. So, a couple of questions on the HR front. With attrition coming\\ndown, will the pressure on giving out more bonuses and increments ease out for you? And\\nalso on this quarter's variable pay, on an organization average level, what is it going to be?\\nAnd if it is 100%, what part of your workforce will be covered in that 100% variable pay\\nbracket?\\nAnd, also on the utilization, excluding trainees, it is at 81.7%. Is it largely because even in the\\nexisting projects, clients want to ramp down, want to bring down the number of billed\\nresources or why is it exactly?\\nNilanjan Roy\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Yes, sure. So, I will take the second and then the first one. So, 81.7% utilization is largely\\nbecause of our fresher's bench. That is the biggest reason and because we have been hiring so\\nmany freshers through the year and putting them into training. So, over a period of time, they\\nwill start going into production, because you cannot overnight put a new project and have\\nthem with all the freshers.\\nAnd like we have talked about in the past, it was an investment we are ready to make because\\nyou cannot overnight flip the model of putting freshers. And so, we are ready to make that\\ninvestment and then start leading them into the production projects and rotate existing\\nheadcount. So, we are not so concerned. Over a period of time, that will start actually helping\\nus.\\nThe second thing about variable pay, we do not disclose the amount of variable pay during\\nthe quarter, and that is just something in the past we have looked at pay out to each quarter on\\nperformance.\\nVeena Mani\\nInaudible question\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, that is been going on. Yes, absolutely. In fact, one of the projects is about helping us\\nduring this attrition - this whole project internally about predictability of promotions, and that\\ncontinues unabated as people reach a certain seniority. And in certain levels, we are\\ncontinuing that.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Sai Ishwar from The Economic Times.\\nSai Ishwar\\nHi gentlemen, good evening. So Salil, in the press release, you have said you have gained\\nmarket share. Could you actually explain in which markets or in which functions are you\\ngaining market share? And, also about the deal win, it has come at an elevated number right\\nnow. So, do you think going forward, it is sustainable? And also, could you tell us what\\nworked this time? Do you think your automation capabilities helped in terms of winning a lot\\nof cost-based deals? Could you just give us more colour on the deal pipeline and the wins?\\nThank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on what are the reasons for some of these deals that we are winning or the size and scale\\nof it, I think you are absolutely right, the automation piece, the fact that we have a real\\nstrength and industry-leading capability has absolutely helped us. We think we are gaining\\nmarket share, because if you look at the growth, average growth over the last 12 months, 24\\nmonths, 36 months, including in this quarter of the industry and you look at our growth, we\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'think we are ahead of the average. So, we are gaining market share from people who are\\nbelow that average and it is in multiple areas. We have gained tremendous market share on\\ncloud because of Cobalt, on the digital areas on data, on analytics and also on cost efficiency\\nand automation, because we have the ability to take large platforms and programs and make\\nthem more efficient for our clients.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Ayushman Baruah from The Financial Express.\\nAyushman Baruah\\nHello. Hi, Salil and team, wishing you a very happy new year, first of all. So, most of the\\nfinancials have been asked. So, I have something from a technology point of view. Last year,\\nwe spoke a lot about Metaverse, right? Infosys has also invested into it. So how do you see\\nthe adoption among clients? Is it still in the initial phases? Or have you seen the adoption\\npick up? That is one.\\nAnd number two is that last year, we also heard a lot about moonlighting, right? So over\\nthese months, has Infosys firmed up any policies around moonlighting yet?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on Meta, I think we are starting to see, as we discussed last time, some projects, some\\nprograms, especially as it relates to AR, VR in the manufacturing context, on a shop floor\\ncontext, in an education training context and maintenance context. It is small right now, so it\\nis not a large part of what we do, but we are seeing a steady sort of improvement on that.\\nOn people doing gig work, we have made a clear statement a while ago. We are very much of\\nthat same view. We have built internal capabilities to support that. We have had a program,\\nwhich internally we call Accelerate, which was put in place some years ago. And that\\nprogram is being used to make sure it is done. We want to ensure, while doing all of that,\\nclient confidentiality is always maintained. But outside of that, we want to make sure that the\\nemployees have the ability to do some of this to improve and enhance their learning.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Haripriya Sureban from The Hindu BusinessLine.\\nHaripriya Sureban\\nHi guys. Salil, you spoke about client spending. But specifically, when it comes to cloud, we\\nhear that people are taking a re-look at their cloud spend and maybe even rethinking how\\nmuch they are spending on it. So, what is it that you see on that front? What is your reading\\non it? And given the current environment, are customers looking at vendor consolidation?\\nAnd would that be helping you going forward? Thanks.\\nSalil Parekh\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"On cloud, it is a significant part of what we see within our digital portfolio. We have seen\\ngood growth in digital all through the year and including in Q3. We do not split out the cloud\\ngrowth specifically, but it is in good shape for us as the cloud business is growing based on\\nCobalt.\\nOverall, we have seen that there is a focus in some of the industry or some verticals that I\\nmentioned earlier, where there is more attention to what should be done with these\\ntransformation programs and much more focus now on how to be more cost efficient. So that\\nis going on as an overlay, but the cloud remains a strong part across all industries.\\nHaripriya Sureban\\nAnd on vendor consolidation?\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn vendor consolidation, we see a tremendous benefit for us. We see many large enterprises\\nare starting to look at things which are more in selecting a very small set of partners. And in\\nmany of those cases, Infosys becomes the preferred partner for our clients.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. We will move on to the next set of questions from journalists who have sent on\\ntext.\\nThe first is from Jochelle Mendonca from ET Prime. Jochelle's question is one thing that we\\nhave seen is Salesforce talking about a slowdown and there is talk about a slowdown on the\\nhyperscaler side as well. Given that you are a strategic partner to these companies, what are\\nyou hearing from them and your clients about the cloud, which has been a big driver of\\ngrowth?\\nAnd the other question is, given the uncertainty, could you give any colour on how close to\\nthe growth your customer teams or any steps that you have taken to be able to capitalize\\nwhen we see an upturn?\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the cloud, I think it is similar to what we were just sort of mentioning. Essentially, there is\\nstill emphasis on what is going on with the cloud. There are just different parts of the\\nindustries that are doing things differently. So, if you look at, for example, in energy or\\nutilities clients, if you look at manufacturing, we see a huge movement today already with\\ncloud with all of the components of our Cobalt capability. But in some other industries, it is\\nless so. And therefore, overall, there is obviously less in that.\\nRishi Basu\\nThe other one was on the uncertainty. Could you give any colour on how close to the growth\\nyour customer teams or any steps that you have taken to be able to capitalize for the time\\nwhen we see an upturn?\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Salil Parekh\\nSo there, I think we are positioned well with the fact that we have a very strong digital\\ntransformation capability. And even today as our clients are looking at it, that capability will\\nbecome more and more critical as and when the overall economy also changes. And in that\\nsame time, the focus on cost efficiency will give us benefit. That is something that we can\\nwork on with clients to rationalize what they are doing with their spend across the technology\\nplatform.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Shouvik Das from Mint.\\nSalil, for you the question is, the per employee consolidated revenue declined further to\\n$54,000 level, down over 6% Y-o-Y. Does this show that employee costs have still remained\\nhigh in the sector despite falling attrition rate? And is this something that we expect to see in\\nthe coming quarters as well?\\nFor Nilanjan, a couple of questions. You have raised guidance for FY'23 on the back of a\\nstrong quarter. However, the number of active $100 million-plus customers reduced by one\\nduring the quarter. Is that a factor of uncertainty coming from North America and Europe?\\nAnd do you expect large deals to remain muted or even decline through the next quarter?\\nThis was already asked.\\nAnd there is another question. Revenue from India saw a 5.4% Y-o-Y constant currency\\ndecline, while the rest of the world, including Europe saw growth. What is the reason for\\nsuch movement in market metrics?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nOkay. So, I will start with India. So, India is a very small portion with about 2.5% of our\\nglobal business is from India. And a lot of the work we do with our clients is also volume and\\ntransaction-led. So, you will see these pluses and minuses on a quarter basis on the growth\\nfigure. But like as I again said, it is only 2.5% approximately our revenue.\\nThe second one was about the revenue per person. I think that is just a reflection of our\\nutilization over the year, which was about 88%, and now we are at 81%. So that is just the\\nmath of the overall RPP as such. So, our margins have, like I said, quarter-on-quarter,\\nremained stable. So that’s a different way to look at the metric because we have also hired\\nfreshers during this time, who are sitting on bench and are in training in Mysore. But from a\\nproductive perspective, we have seen that utilization factor come down by only about one and\\na half percent during the quarter.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Shivani Shinde from Business Standard. In\\ncontinuation to the earlier question on cloud, can you give some colour on cloud deals? If\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"cost transformation deals have gone up, why is the core revenue down in reported terms?\\nAlso, can you give some colour on the TCVs won this quarter?\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the deals, first, the reported terms have a lot of currency in it. So, we always look at our\\nbusiness on a constant currency terms. We think that’s a metric, which is more stable and\\nmore indicative of how the underlying business is doing. So, the key for us there is the core is\\ngrowing this quarter on a constant currency basis.\\nWe don’t typically give out the average TCV on our deals. The reality is we have a huge\\nlarge-deals number at $3.3 bn, and that makes a big difference as we look ahead into what is\\ngoing on with the future of the business. On cloud deals, those really come back to what is\\nthe view of individual clients and within industries what’s happening and then the overlay of\\nthe cloud as an ecosystem.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Reshab Shaw from the Informist. For Salil, you said\\nEurope sees more stress, but segment revenue shows the region's share of revenue is going\\nup. Going forward, do you see that changing? And what are the reasons that drove large deals\\neven as you said there were delays in decision-making?\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn Europe, to the earlier question about what is the overall economic environment like. We\\nsee the economic environment across the world slowing. Within that, relatively, Europe\\nseems to be more slowing than the US today. For our own work, Europe is very strong. We\\nhave had a really good platform there, put in place over the last 18-24 months. And we are\\nseeing the benefits of that coming through today and also some of the large programs that we\\nlaunched in that last 18-24 months' time frame.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Debasis Mohapatra from Deccan Herald.\\nFor Nilanjan, despite a fall in attrition and benefits coming from operational efficiency, why\\ndid operating margin not improve in Q3? Are large deals margin-dilutive in nature? When\\ncan we see revenue per employee inching up?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So, I think I have answered many of those. So, we have given our margin walk on\\n21.5% sequentially as well.\\nAnd the other one - large deals continue to perform well. You will see our overall strategy\\nover the last four years since the large-deal strategy was put in place. At 21.5%, we are\\nactually well above where we started around FY'20. So, despite all the large deals, we have\\nseen that, as we go through the deal cycles, we have seen the improvement in margins. And\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"of course, new deals come into the funnel with lower margins, but that is a mechanism we\\nhave actually mastered, and I think that is something which we do every day.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Rohit Chintapali from Businessworld. This is a similar\\nquestion in case you want to add any more colour to it. Your revenues from North America\\nhave declined sequentially and they have improved only marginally in Europe in Q3. This is\\nin line with ICRA's report that predicts moderation of growth in the IT sector over the\\nmedium term. How do you plan to address these key markets as you expect tough times\\nahead?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nIf you look at our constant currency, we have grown in all the three geographies as Rest of\\nthe World, in Europe and in North America. Of course, the growth rates are different. But we\\nare seeing a very strong pipeline in all the markets, like Salil has mentioned.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Harichandan Arakali from Forbes. Two questions. One\\nis on hiring in the context of looming recession that I think, gentlemen, you have answered.\\nThe next question is, while there is the nuance of Infosys Cobalt and other such capabilities\\nwhich may be useful to clients, overall, what does the recruiting scene look like in the coming\\nfew months?\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn recruitment, I think we have already mentioned – first that we are increasing our growth\\nguidance. We have talked about the recruitment that we have done across this year already.\\nAnd as we see the demand environment building up, as we see utilization inching up, we will\\nmake sure that the recruitment utilization and the way we are training all of the college\\ngraduates makes it an efficient model for us to grow with them.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. With that, we come to the end of this Q&A session and the press conference. We\\nthank our friends from media for joining us today.

Over to you, Salil.\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks Rishi and good evening, good afternoon, welcome to everyone that is here. It is always wonderful to\\nhave all of you here with us on the campus. I am sure you have seen there are a lot more people on the\\ncampus as well, and we are also benefiting from that.\\nWe have had a very strong Q1. Our Q1 growth was solid at 4.2% year-on-year, 1% Q-on-Q in constant\\ncurrency. We had 20% growth in manufacturing, 13% in life sciences. Our European business grew by 10%.\\nOur operating margin for the quarter was strong at 20.8%.\\nOur large deals value for Q1 was at $2.3 bn - 56% of this was net new. This included one mega deal win. We\\nalso announced a mega deal with a value of $2 bn after the close of Q1, but before our results. With strong\\nlarge deal and mega deal wins, we are building well for the future.\\nWe are delighted that Topaz, our Generative AI platform is resonating well with our clients. We are working on\\n80 Generative AI projects for our clients at this time. The work we are doing, covers large language models for\\nsoftware development, for text, document, voice, and video.\\nInternally, we have developed Generative AI tools based on open-source model of Generative AI platforms\\nthat are focused on software development. We have trained 40,000 employees in this area, and we see\\nGenerative AI and Topaz being transformational for all of our clients.\\nIn the short term, we see some clients stopping or slowing down transformation programs and discretionary\\nwork. This is especially so in financial services, in mortgages, asset management, investment banking,\\npayments, and in telecom. We also see some impact in hi-tech industry and in parts of retail.\\nEven as we have won two mega deals recently, we have a strong pipeline of large and mega deals. We see\\nrevenue from some of these and other large deals towards the later part of our financial year. Keeping that in\\nmind, we are changing our revenue growth guidance for this financial year to growth of between 1% to 3.5%\\nin constant currency.\\nWe have launched a broad comprehensive margin expansion program. The program will work across five\\nareas: pyramid efficiency, automation, improvements in critical portfolios, reducing indirect costs, and\\ncommunicating and deriving value across our portfolio.\\nWe have an ambition to improve our operating margins in the future periods. Our operating margin guidance\\nfor this financial year remains unchanged at between 20% and 22%.\\nWith that, let us open it up for questions. Rishi.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

With that, we have the first question from Ritu Singh from CNBC TV18.\\nRitu Singh\\nHi.. The first question, of course, is on your guidance cut. It was a steady quarter for Infosys, whether it is the\\nconstant currency growth, the mega deals that you have announced, couple in the quarter and after the quarter\\nclose. And your TCV is also higher than the previous quarter. What has so drastically changed in the last three\\nmonths for you to cut your guidance from 4% - 7% to 1% - 3.5%, and given that top-line you are expecting\\nlower now for the year, how are you confident of maintaining margins at 20% to 22% for the year? That is the\\nfirst question.\\nAnd also, you know, your commentary from clients in terms of when you see, revival in your discretionary\\nspends from whether it is BFSI, retail, hitech all these areas of concern that you have outlined. And your net\\nemployee reductions for the last couple of quarters, that has also been coming down. So, we wanted to\\nunderstand what your hiring plans are? We understand you have already deferred pay hikes for some of the\\nemployees, if you could give us a sense on that? Thank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the first point, on the revenue growth guidance, we have, as you rightly pointed out, had a good Q1. We\\nhave had good large and mega deals. We have also seen some of these deals, the signings and the start\\ndates being delayed. With that, we see a lot of that revenue from that sort of large and mega deals towards\\nthe later part of the financial year. And through the quarter, we have seen volumes in some of our clients, in\\nthe industries that I shared, were impacted where they were reducing transformational projects or slowing\\ndown decision making. So, when we combined those two and we looked out for the full year, we saw that sort\\nof a range in terms of the growth guidance and decided that we should change our growth guidance.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. We will try to come back to you.\\nRitu Singh\\nThat did not answer my question.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the margin, we have an extremely strong discipline for our operating margin. We have put in place this\\nexpanded margin program that I was referring to. There are five elements of that program, each of them being\\ndriven to make sure we have efficiency. You have also seen utilization in Q1 go up, and we will continue to\\nsee that with all the focus we are putting into productivity. We are also looking at reducing, within those five\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'elements, indirect spends, and cuts of that nature. So, we feel comfortable with our operating margin guidance.\\nAnd our operating margin for Q1 at 20.8% was more towards the middle part of that range.\\nRitu Singh\\nWe have seen a reduction in the headcount for the last couple of quarters, keeping that in mind, what are your\\nhiring plans for the year?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, we still have a target for recruiting for the year, but we will see how that plays out with respect to, what are\\nthe changes in terms of the demand environment and what we do in terms of the attrition numbers that we are\\nseeing. The attrition that we saw in the quarter was stable versus last quarter. Our trailing last 12-month attrition\\nis down to around 17%. So, we see that driving some of the decisions on the recruitments.\\nRitu Singh\\nWhat did you say, your target for hiring for the year was?\\nSalil Parekh\\nWe have not given that target. We said, we will look at that based on what that demand environment looks like\\nand how we see the rest of the year playing out.\\nRishi Basu\\nThanks, Ritu. The next question is from Haripriya Sureban from The Hindu Business Line.\\nHaripriya Sureban\\nWhat is it just for the transformational deals that you are seeing? Or has it translated to the cost takeout kind\\nof - regular kind of deals as well? And given that AI, you have mentioned, you have many active projects, do\\nyou think that will sort of help you with margins as well, given that it is coming at a higher price point?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on the first, the decision making we see has slowed down across large programs. The way a lot of the\\ntransformation programs that are running today, they are funded from cost efficiency that comes through that\\nprogram itself. So overall, the decision making sometimes is slowing down. And we are seeing the start dates\\nin terms of where some of these programs are likely to start, more towards the back end of the year. And that\\nis the reason we are seeing the revenue impact through the year.\\nOn Generative AI, we are excited to be doing 80 projects. AI programs generally have a good margin. They\\nhave a lot of work which is focused on enhancing productivity, driving new areas of growth. But at this stage,\\nit is a start. So, we will see when that scales up what the impact of margin is.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Rishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Shilpa Phadnis from The Times of India.\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nHello Sir. If you just look at your sequential revenue growth of 1%,\\nOn an annualized basis, you could have grown at 4% and your guidance is sub-par. So, I just wanted to\\nunderstand from you, are there deep client concerns that has, you know, made Infosys scale down the\\nguidance significantly?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, the discussion on the guidance is sort of similar. We have seen many of these large and mega deal wins\\nreally give us much more confidence in the way clients are working with us, especially on cost efficiency, even\\nwith financial services, when we announce on transformation and also consolidation. However, there have\\nbeen delays in the start of some of these programs and the decision-making in those.\\nCoupled with that, we have also seen some of the volume during the quarter coming down because of clients\\nin the industries that I mentioned, so financial services, asset management, payments, mortgages, telco, etc.,\\nin those specific industries, reducing their volume of work. And those two things have combined for reducing\\nthe guidance.\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nI had one more question on your deal win. You spoke about the $2 bn deal win. Would that qualify as Infosys'\\nbiggest win that could potentially surpass Daimler?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo first, we are now sharing the deal value making sure that that is aligned to the regulations that are there.\\nFor the past, we have actually never shared the deal value. So, it will be difficult to compare that.\\nShilpa Phadnis\\nAnd one last thing on the headcount, Sir. The sector itself is going through a lot of people challenges, you\\nknow, deferments of hikes and increments. So, if you can please clarify, what is the kind of hikes that you plan\\nto roll out this year? Is it going to be deferred at all levels? We are getting to hear that senior level hikes are\\ngetting deferred. Can you please throw some light on that?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So actually, on the compensations, we are actively under consideration as we speak. So, I am sure, you\\nwill hear of it even before we finalize that, but it is under active consideration.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Rishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Chandra Ranganathan and Haripriya Suresh from Moneycontrol.com.\\nChandra Ranganathan\\nHi. Salil, you know, on the guidance, again, I wanted to understand what has changed in one quarter, 4%-7%\\nto, you know, 1%-3.5%, any specific ramp-downs that you are seeing, what exactly is happening? And when\\nwe spoke to other managements, they say that, even though transformative programs, discretionary has\\nslowed down, clients are still going in for short-term ROI projects. So, you know, is that something that you are\\nlooking at in the pipeline?\\nSecondly, Nilanjan, on the hikes, you said it is under consideration, by when do you expect to announce?\\nHaripriya Suresh\\nHi, also wanted to get some perspective on your, you have seen some top level exits recently as well. Is that\\na matter of concern? And what are you doing to sort of stem top level attrition? Just wanted to understand that.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, the first question on the guidance, I think the way we have seen it is, what we saw in the start of the quarter,\\nwe had a certain view of where our large and mega deals were in terms of, when they would close and when\\nsome of that work would start. Plus, what was the volume on the other programs, on the transformation\\nprograms, on the digital programs, on our overall volume of work across the portfolio.\\nWhat we saw is some of the start dates for the large deals, the mega deals were more later in the year. And\\nthe decision making, even as we have announced two of them, we still have some in our pipeline and we will\\nsee those over the course of the year as the pipeline evolves, and the volume which we saw the changes in\\nfor many discretionary projects or some of the transformation work.\\nCombining all of that is where we decided that this was the guidance in terms of the growth that we could see\\ntoday in terms of the outlook. What we do see is, as we look towards the back end of the year, much more\\ngrowth orientation, because some of these deals will at that stage start to deliver their revenue as well.\\nChandra Ranganathan\\nShort term, are you seeing more, the nature of the deals becoming more short term, ROI, cost takeout?\\nSalil Parekh\\nYes, so we are definitely seeing consolidation, cost efficiency, automation, but we are not seeing short term,\\nmeaning short projects like that. But those are the types of deals we are seeing which is more focused on the\\nefficiency as opposed to transformation.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'On the compensation, Nilanjan will come, I will just go with the third one first. We have seen, we have\\nannounced and rolled out our new leadership structure within the company. We have the great fortune of\\nhaving incredible leadership talent within the company. And each of them, several of them are stepping up into\\nnew roles, driving the growth of this business.\\nAs you can see from these two mega deals and other large deals, overall strength of the business, those\\npeople have stepped in, and my sense is Infosys will continue to produce those sort of leaders.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, so I think, like I said, this is under consideration, so we will come back on the timing etc., but as of now,\\nwe are looking at it. We are looking at it as we speak.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Sai Ishwar from the Economic Times.\\nSai Ishwarbharath\\nHello, gentlemen. So, Salil, you were talking about the fall in volumes across the portfolio, right? So, what\\nexactly is the reason for this fall in volume? Are clients fearing the recession and tightening their spends. And\\nI just wanted to ask about the $100 mn-plus clients, it is falling by 2 sequentially. So, is that because of the\\nramp-down or is it because of projects getting completed? Thank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn the first one, the volumes, there mainly, it is clients in the industries that I was referencing, trying to maintain\\ntheir cost discipline to reduce what they consider discretionary in the short term. So, we see many of these\\nsorts of actions, for example, in mortgages and financial services, or we see that in telecom, or we see that in\\ninvestment banking, or we see that in hitech. Those are the sorts of projects that typically have got less\\nattention in Q1.\\nSai Ishwarbharath\\nSo, have you priced in, like you said a lot of these start dates are baked in the second half of the year, right?\\nSo, the guidance now has baked in all the expected revenues, or do we see any improvement in guidance?\\nSalil Parekh\\nWhat we have announced as our wins on large deals and mega deals that is already in the guidance we have\\ngiven. As we go through the year, as there are more events in terms of wins, we will see what impact that has.\\nThere could be impacts which are positive there could be impacts, depending on some of things, gets delayed\\nor not. But as of what we see today is what we have put into the guidance.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Nilanjan Roy\\nOn those two, I mean, I cannot specifically comment on those two specific clients. But generally, as Salil said,\\nthe overall impact had a discretionary spend cut rather than any projects fundamentally getting over, that is\\nthe general theme.\\nSai Ishwarbharath\\nSo, they shifted one bucket lower?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, they shifted. So, if you see above 50, that is not changed.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you, Sai. The next question is from Ayushman Baruah from the Business Standard.\\nAyushman Baruah\\nHi. A lot has been spoken about AI, so keen to know, what percentage of deals are AI led? Do you see a\\ncomponent of AI in majority of the deals? Is AI integrated in most of the deal conversations that you have?\\nThat is first.\\nAnd secondly, on the pricing, are you seeing any pricing pressure as such? Thank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\nOn pricing, Nilanjan will come back on that. On AI, first, we do not disclose the percentage of AI within our\\nportfolio. However, AI or Generative AI is really transformative, and it is something that is changing everything\\nthat is going on. For example, we are doing work, which is related to software development, which is related\\nto new code enhancements, migration, maintenance that covers the spectrum of the work that we do. And it is\\nalso related to other areas, for example, voice, video, text. These are areas where we do work, which is\\nexpanding the type of work we are doing. So, my sense is Generative AI is really going to transform everything\\nthat is happening within our portfolio. And Topaz that we have launched, being the leading platform or set of\\ncapabilities for Generative AI, I think will make a huge impact. Having 80 active projects is a massive step and\\nit is moving with rapid speed.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nThe pricing environment remains quite stable. We have seen in some places, we are able to get some\\nincreases from cola, etc. Some cases isolated again, you get some discounts, but by and large it is a very\\nstable environment.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Rishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Uma Kannan from The New Indian Express.\\nUma Kannan\\nGood evening, gentlemen. You said, there are some softeners in verticals like BFSI, hitech. So, will this\\ncontinue, or will it be better going forward in H2? And I also want to know, where are the headwinds coming\\nfrom? And is it really paradoxical times for the IT industry as such?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, on the first part, what we look at is, what we see within our portfolio on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.\\nIt is, from our perspective, not something we look at as to when something will stop or not stop. We have within\\nour portfolio, work that we can do on digital transformation, cloud, Generative AI, which are really growth drivers\\nin the market. When clients or industries are looking at that we are ready with that, and we have that as one\\nof our growth engines.\\nOn the other hand, when clients are looking at cost, efficiency, consolidation, we also have deep capability in\\nthat, and that is some of these wins that you have seen, that we have announced, are reflective of that. So\\nthat is what will kick in, in the other side, but we do not have a specific view on when something will change in\\nthat.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Sameer Bakshi from the Financial Express.\\nSameer Ranjan Bakshi\\nHello, Sir. So, in these times, do you see challenges in winning smaller deals, when there is a cut in\\ndiscretionary spend? And the second one is, when your peers are focusing on Europe, why are you not able\\nto consolidate the European market? Your revenue has fallen by 2%. Thank you.\\nSalil Parekh\\nIn Europe,I will come to that, on a constant currency basis, we are at a growth of 10%. So, Europe, in fact, you\\nare absolutely right, is an area, we have a lot of attention and focus on. And in many of those markets, we are\\nexpanding quite well.\\nOn the smaller projects, we do not see a difference. We are comfortable to win larger programs and smaller\\nprograms. It is just that there are some, which are more, not smaller but more discretionary from the perspective\\nof a client, which is where we see some of the volume impact. On the larger mega deals, actually we are\\nseeing very good traction in the two wins but also a good pipeline of large and mega deals.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Rishi Basu\\nThank you. The next question is from Varun Vyas from Reuters News.\\nVarun Vyas\\nHello. I was wondering if you could tell me, if the results missed the company's own expectations and when\\nyou might see some recovery? And could you explain how you classify large and mega deals? Like, is there a\\ncertain threshold above which a deal is considered that?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, the way we see this, we find that when we look at things like Generative AI or if you look at the mega deals\\nor the large deals, we see very good traction and momentum. When we see volumes on discretionary projects,\\nwe see some of those slowing down. So, in that sense it is not one size that fits all, we are seeing really good\\ntraction on the former. In terms of classification, it is $50 mn or larger that is classified within our system as\\nlarge deal, and $500 mn or larger is a mega deal.\\nVarun Vyas\\nI was wondering, if you could also tell me what kind of variable pay you are paying.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, we do not comment on that externally.\\nRishi Basu\\nThanks, Varun. The next question is from Shraddha Goled from the Mint.\\nShraddha Goled\\nHi, good evening. I wanted to ask about the Generative AI training that you mentioned. About 40,000\\nemployees are being trained. So, what kind of training are they undergoing, more details on that? And also\\nwanted to know, if any Generative AI apps or tools are being used internally for any of the operations or\\nfunctions?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on the training, we are working with clients on both open-source Generative AI platforms and proprietary\\nGenerative AI platforms. These span from different tech companies. Our training internally is on many of these\\ndifferent platforms. Plus, we have built some tools on an open-source Generative AI platform that we are using\\ninternally for areas where we do software development. For example, in our products business, in some other\\nareas of services, where we are doing new code development, enhancements or migration.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'So for all of those we have built some tools on open-source platforms. So, the training is on those elements of\\nthose platforms. We have in fact, rolled out what we call ‘AI assistance’ for our employees where the employees\\nare focused on delivery work, which is in the software development area, on the sales work, on training, on\\nknowledge management, on different components of the work. So, for us, really, we are becoming an AI-first\\ncompany, driving through the change internally as well as externally.\\nShraddha Goled\\nAre you also using for your internal operations?\\nSalil Parekh\\nYes, absolutely. So those are the ones which we are using internally as well.\\nRishi Basu\\nThanks, Shraddha. The next question is from Reshab Shaw from The Informist.\\nReshab Shaw\\nHi, gentlemen. We have seen utilization going up by 2 basis points and attrition coming down. What stopped\\nus from reaching the upper end of the margin guidance?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So, I think guidance of 20% to 22%, I mean, we ended the year as you know at 21% for the full year and\\nfor the quarter. So, at 20.8%, it is about a 20-basis points reduction. We know, we have levers available, like\\nutilization is definitely, one of them. And the program which we have put into place has actually got five pillars.\\nThe first is automation through Generative AI. The second is a much more beneficial hierarchy index. The third\\nis through more critical portfolio of projects. Fourth is value-based selling, the pricing, and the fifth is a whole\\nindirect cost initiative. So, this is a five-pillar holistic approach we are taking. It has got about 20 tracks and it\\nis being led by Jayesh.\\nSo, we have 30 leaders leading all these tracks. And definitely the aspiration is to continue to grow our margins\\nin the medium term and long term.\\nRishi Basu\\nThank you. With that, we come to an end of this Q&A session.

Service\\nclients are focused on consolidation and M&A, cloud cost optimization and legacy transformation.\\nOur investment in industry cloud and solutions in the energy transition area had helped us\\ndifferentiate in these sectors to win multiple deals and build a very strong pipeline.\\nManufacturing clients are focusing on controlling the spend and awarding deals which are focused\\non differentiation. Despite the volatile environment, deal pipeline is strong. Areas like, engineering,\\nIoT, supply chain, cloud, ERP and digital are seeing increased traction. There is a need to increase\\npaper migration to cloud, increasing productivity by transforming to smart factories and transitioning\\nto smart products. We are seeing opportunities across auto, aerospace and industrial.\\nWe have revised our revenue growth guidance for FY '24 to 1.0% to 3.5% in constant currency terms.\\nThis is due to lower-than-expected volumes, due to ramp-down in discretionary spend, coupled with\\nlower mega deal volumes arising from delayed timing and longer ramp-up times due to regulatory\\napprovals and transition.\\nMargin guidance remained at 20% to 22% for FY '24. We continue to aspire for higher margins over\\nthe medium term with the razor-sharp focus on cost optimization and efficiency improvements. As\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Salil mentioned, we have launched a new margin maximization program across the five pillars\\ncomprising over 20 tracks.\\nWith that, we can open up the call for questions.\\nModerator\\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. The first question is from\\nthe line of Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak. Please go ahead.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nYeah, hi. Thank you. You know, my first question is the fact that in the prepared remarks, both\\nNilanjan and Salil, both of you mentioned that the guidance cut is partly due to a delay in volumes or\\nthe delay in timing of mega deals. But as far as I remember, your guidance at the lower end was not\\npredicated on mega deal closures, which is 4%, and 7% was predicated on mega deal closures and\\nvolumes flowing through.\\nSo I'm just trying to understand, if you can just delayer your guidance, you know basically just\\nhighlight what percentage of the cut is attributable to your perception of change in view in the external\\nenvironment and what percentage is really the delayed signing of mega deals here?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So Kawal as you know, there was a guidance of 4% to 7%. Of course, the higher end of the\\nguidance had a larger amount of the mega deals. And the 4%, of course, was predicated a lot on the\\nbase volumes, which by default would be in quarter 1, quarter 2. And this is where we have seen\\ndiscretionary spend cuts in quarter 1 in some clients, and of course, in Q2 as well, some of that\\nsoftness continues.\\nAs you know, if you have to meet the year, quarter 1 and quarter 2 are very critical for that really to\\nhappen. So fundamentally, that is the base reason. As we exit the year, of course, at the higher end,\\nthere was the impact of mega deals and our guidance on both ends have come down. And one more\\nreason is that the top-end has come down is also largely also due to the delay in mega deals signing\\nand the transition time. But the pipeline, as Salil said is very healthy. We got two deals under the\\nbelt, and we are as confident as we exit the year.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nBut Nilanjan, just to try to know, when you basically spoke in the last quarter, you did highlight that\\n1Q would be weaker and we expect pickup in 2Q, whereas right now you are saying that 1Q and 2Q\\nare strong quarters. I'm just trying to understand the disconnect in commentary.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"The second part to the question Nilanjan is that, two consecutive quarters, two consecutive misses.\\nI guess last time around as well, there were a lot of pushback saying that the environment has\\ndeteriorated and how you built any extra cushion into your guidance, etc. So what are your learnings\\nin the last two quarters? And what are the steps you have taken to ensure that the forecasting\\nprocess is a little bit more robust than what the guidance cut in the last two quarters indicate?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYeah. So Kawal see, when we give the guidance, we see the outlook at that point of time. We have\\na semblance of what is a pipe. We assume some convertibility. There is an existing book of business.\\nBut like I just said, in Q1, from a sequential basis, we are lower than where we thought we would\\nend up to be, right?\\nBecause like I said, Q1 and Q2 was critical for us to meet that guidance. And we have seen these\\ndiscretionary cuts in clients in some sectors which we have just called out. And that is, what I would\\nsay, the base business. And on the other side, there is the mega deal impact. We have got a good\\npipeline and some of these deals which was supposed to kick-in earlier, are getting delayed later\\ninto the year as we speak.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nOkay, that is clear. Just a final comment on how the pipeline after the conversion of the $2 bn mega\\ndeal as such? Can you just comment on the pipeline? That will be useful.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo Kawal, this is Salil. The pipeline, we still have a good pipeline of both large deals. We have some\\nmega deals in the pipeline as well. We see a lot of the work that we are doing on cost, on efficiency,\\nautomation, in consolidation those are tracking well with clients. There are some transformation\\nprograms which are funded from within the cost efficiency those are also something that we are\\ntracking through. So we do see with the two mega deals signed, a good pipeline today of large deals\\nand we have mega deals in the pipeline as well.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nRight. And just one thing, is the upper end of the guidance band in any way predicated on future\\nmega deal closures, or it's based on the deals closed up to now?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo here, the way we have built this guidance, or our view of the 3.5% is based on what we have\\nclosed today in large and mega deals, and then we have a way of estimating based on what we see\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'into the future as an aggregate, not as a one-off, or not as a binary discussion, but in aggregate with\\nwhat we see as the probabilities and also the probability of when that work will transition and the\\nrevenues are . So those are what we see in the pipeline and are baked into it.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nThank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Yogesh Aggarwal from HSBC. Please go ahead.\\nYogesh Aggarwal\\nYeah, hi. Thanks for letting me come. Salil, just a couple of questions. Firstly, on banking, your\\nbanking weakness has been there for a few quarters and now most other companies are showing\\nweakness as well. Whereas if you look at the clients itself, most of their financial results, the tech\\ncommentaries and the data is not that weak. So where is the disconnect you think? Are they spending\\nmore with captives or smaller subcontractors? Where is this market share loss coming from?\\nSalil Parekh\\nYogesh, I think, what we see in our financial services or banking part of financial services, there are\\ndifferent clients of ours that have different patterns in terms of their own pressures within their\\nbusiness. Some of our clients have had good results, but there are some which have had more\\ndifficult economic situations.\\nAlso with a mix from geography between Europe, Asia Pacific, and US, when you break it down into\\nspecific sub-industry areas, when you look at asset management, when you look at investment\\nbanking, when you look at payments or mortgages, those are the ones where we are seeing the\\nimpact.\\nOur sense is, generally our clients are not spending on those projects. It is not that they are spending\\nsomewhere else. Typically, they are choosing not to spend at this time. And as the environment\\nchanges, we will see how that pattern changes.\\nYogesh Aggarwal\\nOkay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up. The revised guidance now, at the lower end, I wanted to\\nask, you have already won few mega deals and the lower end of the guidance suggests almost\\nnegative or flattish growth for the next three quarters, which would also mean that for six quarters,\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"seven quarters now, revenues would be flat. So what are the assumptions for the lower end of the\\nguidance I wanted to know?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSee, here as Nilanjan was sharing about the guidance, the approach is really focused on what we\\nhave seen in terms of volumes, discretionary projects in Q1 and an overlay then of the actual mega\\ndeals and large deals we have already won, and the estimate that we are looking at.\\nSome of those deals have start dates have moved out, whereas the volume and discretionary project\\nslowing is still in quarter. So our view is based on how that plays out between those trends, we saw\\nthe 1% in terms of the lower end of the guidance when you combine that and then, of course, the\\nhigh end we talked about earlier.\\nYogesh Aggarwal\\nGreat. Thanks, Salil. Thank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nThank you. Salil, thank you for the updated guidance. I just wanted to get a sense of, obviously, the\\nask rate for the next three quarters has now moderated from, maybe it could have been 2% to 4%.\\nWith the same old guidance, it's 0% to 1.5% as discussed. Just curious about the discretionary cuts\\nand the delays you referenced in your guidance change description. Has this happened more\\ntowards the latter half of the quarter? Has there been a linear change over the course of the quarter?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, Ankur, the way we have seen it is, there will be no difference in the pattern at the beginning\\nor the end of the quarter. It is more focused on the industry that we referenced in our opening remarks\\nbetween Nilanjan and me. We have seen in different places the discretionary work and some\\ntransformation work, where it has either slowed or stopped based on different industries.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nOkay. And also, I just want to get a sense of maybe asking this in a slightly different way. Obviously,\\nthe guidance change is quite drastic. Is this just the change in environment of spending over the\\ncourse of the last three months? Or is this also a difference in the way you measure the likelihood of\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"success of when the deals ramp-up, or the win rate of future deals? Just curious about that and if\\nthis guidance is more conservative anyway versus the last time you said it?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, it is a combination, as you pointed out, of the environment in terms of the discretionary or\\ntransformational projects in the quarter. And then some of the mega deals and large deals, we saw\\na delay in decision-making in closing and also delay or changes in the start time or ramp-up of the\\nprofile of that deal. We have actually not seen any change in the win rate. And in fact, internally, we\\nhad a good win rate in Q1, and we continue to see good traction, whether it is consolidation, cost\\nefficiency on the win rate side.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nAppreciate that. Just one clarification, if you could. I know this $2 bn framework agreement that you\\nreferenced is the second large deal. Could you clarify if this is fully contracted? And is this type of\\ndeal historically also been disclosed in your TCV’s over the last few quarters or years?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThis deal, while we have first made the announcement, and I'm sure you have seen, we have\\ncompleted the contract signing of the deal, that is when the deal was announced. These types of\\ndeals were also included in the past within our large deal mix. Of course, in the past, there was no\\nrequirement of disclosing the specific values.\\nAnkur Rudra\\nOkay. Understood. Last question if I can. On margins, they were obviously flattish this time, it seemed\\nlike you have done well given what the growth has been. The five-point margin maximization plan\\nyou have highlighted, is this you playing offense or defense on margins? In other words, is Infosys\\nconfident of potentially expanding margins in F '24? Or is it more for margin defense because growth\\noutlook does not look very strong, at least at the lower end of guide?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So like we said, I mean, this is a two-year program we have started. It is quite comprehensive.\\nIt is just not looking at cost, it is looking at portfolio. And this is now being led personally by Jayesh\\nwith 20 tracks, 30 leaders. Of course, our aspiration continues to be that we will aspire for higher\\nmargins than where we are today. So from that perspective, it is offensive -- on offense, I would say\\noffensive, but on offense, this thing to increase our margins. That is the intent.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Ankur Rudra\\nAppreciate it, thank you, and best of luck.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Apurva Prasad from HDFC Securities. Please go\\nahead.\\nApurva Prasad\\nYes, thanks for taking my question. Salil, just wanted a broad further on the guidance. In the last\\nquarter, you had referred to achieving top-end basis the strength of pipeline and factors that are\\nbinary. So are those binary factors still in the pipeline or converted but transition is taking longer? So\\nwhat I am trying to get at is how should we really reconcile the change in revenue guide in the last\\nthree months between delay and volume cuts, which is as large as $600 mn?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, we have already announced two mega deals, which is a positive. We have large and mega\\ndeals in the pipeline. The way we have seen it is really the two points you mentioned, which is the\\nvolume discretionary work in quarter and the delay in the start of the realization, transition of some\\nof the large and mega deals, those are what have translated to the change in the guidance.\\nApurva Prasad\\nAny way that you could split those factors, how much of an impact would that have been?\\nSalil Parekh\\nWe will not be in a position to quantify that further between those two, unfortunately.\\nApurva Prasad\\nSo okay. And just how would you characterize the business environment and your client\\nconversations at the end of the quarter as compared to how it was at the beginning of the quarter?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, it is really, the way we see it is, our pipeline for large and mega deals is in excellent shape\\nas we closed the quarter. We see good traction for mega deals and our large deals. The focus is\\nmuch more when you are talking to clients on efficiency or cost or consolidation. We have a real\\ntraction with them. We see less discussions on digital transformation.\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'And then in general, across the client base for those industries that I referenced in the opening\\nremark, we see where there are discretionary programs where the client feels that they can slow\\nthem or pause them for some time, we see that action. So those are the two sort of actions we are\\nseeing. Very good traction, in fact, on the large and mega deals.\\nModerator\\nApurva, does that answer your question?\\nApurva Prasad\\nYes, thanks.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas Please go ahead.\\nKumar Rakesh\\nHi, good evening. Thank you for taking my question. My first question was more of a clarification. So\\ncan you just confirm the process of deciding the revenue growth guidance? Is it the same, which\\nwas last fiscal year versus this year? Or have you changed some of the assumptions for the\\nprocesses that you follow?\\nSalil Parekh\\nHi, Rakesh. This is Salil. So we have following the same approach that we followed over the last\\nseveral years as we build our outlook or our guidance that we share with the market.\\nKumar Rakesh\\nGreat. Got it. Thanks. My second question was on the margin side. So this quarter, we had a slight\\ndecline on the margin sequentially. Now wage hike is yet to be given out. So how confident are you\\non holding on to the current margin or the margins which we had last year? And the cost saving\\nprogram also you are going to start running? Or there would be more of headwinds than tailwinds\\non the margin side?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nAs you saw my margin walk, we had a 70 basis points benefit from utilization, cost optimization. So\\nwe are seeing the tailwinds of that. And the big part of that, we actually put back into employeerelated compensation, which is variable pay, that is a big part - promotion. So it is not that we are\\nlosing that to the market. That is a conscious decision for us to plow it back towards employees.\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'So as we look ahead, we are actively considering compensation hikes, we announced this as well\\nat press conference earlier. And the new program that kicks-in, we think in optimization will give us\\nthe necessary tailwinds to be well within the margin guidance band.\\nKumar Rakesh\\nThanks for that. My last question was around the volume commentary which you gave. So last\\nquarter in April when we had the discussion. You had talked about that volume through the quarter,\\nyou were seeing signs of improvement. However, in this quarter, you have seen performing much\\nbelow your expectation. So which are specific pockets you are seeing the weakness specifically? Is\\nit more client specific or the entire industry working a much sharper weakness?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nIt is a client-specific, like this time iIn fact, we saw slightly more resilience in the US-based clients.\\nEurope turned out to be slightly weaker. So it is very client specific actually across. I mean, it is sort\\nof a leaking bucket in a number of clients. There is no large drop-off. And this is largely with the\\ndiscretionary part. So it is some programs which can be pulled back and are discretionary in the\\nnature, those are the ones we are seeing.\\nKumar Rakesh\\nThanks for that.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go\\nahead.\\nJames Friedman\\nHi, thank you. Salil, I think many investors are wondering, so I appreciate your thoughts. Does it\\nseem to you that the soft demand was primarily due to macro factors, which are presumably\\ntemporary? Or is it potentially something more profound like perhaps related to the relevance of\\nservices or mindshare? So is this just macro it is going to go away, or is it a question of services in\\nitself?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo this is Salil. Thanks for the question. The way we see it today, we see this demand environment,\\nespecially on discretionary, that we have been discussing so far, as a function of the macro\\nenvironment. We can see, for example, if you look at different industries, manufacturing growing at\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  '21%, other industry is doing well, whereas financial service is weaker. So our service portfolio, we\\nbelieve, works well.\\nWe have already transformed the company, moved it predominantly into a digital business. We are\\nvery strong on cloud with our cobalt offering. And now with generative AI and broadly with AI, we\\nhave launched our Topaz offering.\\nMy sense is that those are resonating well with clients. And the places where we see the constraints\\nhave been more with the macro. Even some of the large and mega deals we are winning, we are\\nwinning against a fairly intense competition where we are demonstrating our capabilities, whether it\\nis on transformation or on cost or efficiency or consolidation.\\nJames Friedman\\nOkay, thank you for that context, Salil. I will drop back in the queue.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Abhishek Bhandari from Nomura. Please go ahead.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nYeah. Thank you. I have two questions. First of all, Salil, congrats to you for this $2 bn mega deal.\\nAnd if you could share some more details around this project given that it is probably the largest you\\nannounced anywhere globally. Is it pure services deal? Or there is an element of any hardware\\npurchase along with it? And do you think this will get into revenue translation more in the second half\\nof this year?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo thanks for the question. On this specific deal, what we have shared in the public domain is as per\\nthe filing with the stock exchange. It really focuses on work that we are doing related to AI and\\nautomation-led development, modernization and maintenance services. We do not have anything\\nmore to add to that comment.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nSure. And do you think this goes into revenue translation in second half?\\nSalil Parekh\\nYes. So again, there, we do not have anything more on the specific deal. It is more about the general\\ncomments that we have talked about the large and mega deals. We do see, in general, across our\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'large and mega deals, the revenue coming through in terms of the transitions and revenue realization\\nmore towards the later part of the year.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nGot it. Thank you Salil for that. Nilanjan, my final and second question is to you. So you commented\\nthat the salary hikes are under active consideration. So do you think this year, the hike cycle could\\ndiffer compared to a usual cycle? And it could be more linked to when the growth comes back, we\\nprobably will be in a better position to give the hikes for employees?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo like I said, we are considering everything. Nothing to add more than that really in terms of timing\\nor anything like that.\\nAbhishek Bhandari\\nOkay, got it. Thank you and all the best.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go\\nahead.\\nMoshe Katri\\nSo far, Europe has really been holding up well, much better than the US. Can you talk a bit about\\nwhat you are seeing in Europe, maybe areas where you are seeing some strength in terms of\\nverticals? I am assuming the UK is a big part of it. And if that trend continues based on what you are\\nseeing, i.e. is Europe still holding in there or is it also slowing down? That is my first question, thanks.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo thanks to your question. This is Salil. We saw good traction, and we have seen that over the last\\nseveral quarters in Europe, as you pointed out. We have seen that, especially in the manufacturing\\nsegment. We have had good traction in multiple geographies in Europe. So we have a good traction\\nin the Nordics. We also announced a strategic win in the Nordics, which was public a few weeks\\nago. We have good traction in Germany, as you referenced, a good traction in the UK. So we have\\nhad good traction so far.\\nNow the macro environment, we feel, as Nilanjan also pointed earlier, is definitely something that is\\naffecting overall in Europe. So we are seeing within the segments we referenced, for example,\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Financial Services and the sub-segments there in telco, in some parts of retail, those being impacted\\nin Europe as well, and we will see how that plays out into the future.\\nMoshe Katri\\nOkay. And my follow-up is about an article that came out this week in the local media in India,\\nsuggesting that there is an uptick in demand for lateral hires in the industry. And these hires will\\nprobably start happening in the month of October and on. Does that make sense to you versus what\\nyou are seeing out there in terms of demand and pipeline and the ramp up, that is kind of, as you\\nsaid, it is going slower than expected?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo for that, my sense is, again, some of the comments you might have heard earlier from Nilanjan,\\nour utilization has gone up. Our total headcount number is reduced, and we believe, we have some\\nheadroom for the utilization to go up further. So that would be the context in which we are operating.\\nMoshe Katri\\nUnderstood. Thanks for the color.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Mukul Garg from Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nMukul Garg\\nYes. Hi, thanks. Salil, just wanted to kind of probe a bit further on the change in the guidance, and\\nI'm just focusing on the lower end of your previous guidance. Where it does not look like the miss in\\nQ1 from what you are kind of thinking about last quarter was that meaningful for the guidance at the\\nlower end to come down so drastically.\\nSo is it fair to assume that, the incremental slowdown which you have witnessed is more front ended,\\ni.e. in Q2? Or was there an expectation of a meaningful pickup-in the business in the second half,\\nwhich is now no longer there?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo on the guidance, again, some of the comments that Nilanjan shared earlier, we saw in Q1, the\\nvolume and discretionary projects slowing. And based on that, plus the delay in some of the large or\\nmega deals are starting up in terms of revenue, we felt that has given us the view of the lower end\\nof the guidance.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'What we see really the function of the way, the volume in the discretionary project evolves. The\\nmacro environment, as we look out, is changing as we see things, which are from US to Europe, to\\nAsia, keeping those factors in mind is how we build that lower end of the guidance.\\nMukul Garg\\nSure. And similarly, on similar track, is there something, we need to kind of see, visualize in terms of\\nsanctity of large deal TCV, which we disclosed. The commentary on pipeline and large deal wins\\ncontinues to remain very robust. But there is a fair bit of pain, which you are kind of talking about\\nfrom a discretionary side, which would be coming out of the large deal number.\\nSo can you share the impact on overall TCV? Or is that something, which you would kind of start\\nreassessing simply because it is giving a misleading picture, when you look at only the large deals\\nwins?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there are some distinctions, what we are seeing in the large deals, mega deals, wins in the\\npipeline and what is more recent in the past quarters is more on cost or efficiency or consolidation.\\nAnd so that work is continuing.\\nWhat we referenced on the slowdown is more on discretionary projects, which are projects or\\ntransformation projects, which are from before, which could have been paused or slowed down by\\nthe client, and specifically in the industries, where we referenced the impact. Those are the ones,\\nwe are seeing. So they are not, in a sense, correlated with the large deals that we are looking at\\ntoday.\\nMukul Garg\\nSure. And if I may just ask one clarification. You know, is there any impact in terms of your growth\\nguidance from any client-specific issue, specifically, as Nilanjan kind of highlighted in Europe, in\\nterms of client in-sourcing or kind of slowing down business to you, in any vertical?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, what Nilanjan was referencing to is not that it is client specific, as you know, in one or two\\nclients. It was more in terms of clients within that industry vertical and more now shifting, what we\\nhad in the US to the European market. So it is not that we have specific one or two clients, where\\nwe have seen this impact showing up from there.\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

So, I know that you do not share this data point, but could you give us a\\ndirectional sense of how ACV, annualized contract value trends would have moved or would\\ncompare Y-o-Y, given the changing nature of the things towards the large and mega cost takeout\\ndeals?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks for the questions, Surendra.

              "  'Prashant Kothari\\nYeah. A couple of questions. One is, when you are looking at the revenue growth guidance this year,\\nit seems we will be growing maybe worse than the peer group that we track, even in terms of the\\ndeciding on management compensation, how do we think about that? What are the things that we\\nneed to do in order to regain the kind of competitiveness in the market, so we can continue to outgrow\\nout there? Or do you think, it is all down to discretionary demand being weak and therefore, there is\\nnothing much that we can do, and we just need to wait for the cycle to come back? That is the first\\nquestion.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, we have a view with our portfolio. There is a portfolio of services that works well with our\\nclients. We absolutely have the intensity in the client environment with a large and mega deal wins\\nto be back into the growth mode that we have been in for the last several years.\\nWe also have a high base for comps. Q1 of last year was a 21% growth year-on-year, in the previous\\nyear, whereas the environment of other peers were not there. So all of those factors coming into\\nplay, we are very much of the view that, we have what we need, and we are continuing to go into\\nnew areas, like, generative AI or continued investments in cloud to build out, what we want, what our\\nclients are looking for, to continue with the growth situation.\\nPrashant Kothari\\nOkay. Thank you. So if it is kind of more about the external environment then, what would be a good\\nkind of a leading indicator that you would use may be internally to figure out that, this weak\\ndiscretionary demand phase is kind of coming to an end?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo internally, we have several elements, that we look at. These are not typically data we share\\nexternally. But in terms of the overall translation of that is what we translate into the guidance there.\\nPrashant Kothari\\nAll right. Yeah, which is presenting a bit of a weak picture as of now. All right. Okay. Thank you very\\nmuch.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen.

Can you give us a sense of materiality to just how are you thinking\\nabout the potential cost savings or an approximate margin expansion potential that you expect to\\nachieve from these pillars?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So we cannot really quantify it. These are five critical tracks, pricing and a more holistic sort of\\nvalue-based selling approach. That is a big one. We know from a pyramid perspective, we have a\\nlot of scope as well. We understand the generative AI and our ongoing automation projects, which\\nwe have. That is a continuously and actually with generative AI, we think, we can up the productivity\\nfrom baseline even more.\\nSome of our portfolios in our mix, how do we improve margins, – a dedicated head team looking at\\nthese accounts. And finally, the indirect cost side and how do we keep a cap on that, looking at more\\nefficient buying, procurement, savings, etc.\\nSo it is a quite a holistic approach, like I said, across 20 tracks. And these are being kicked-off. We\\ncannot quantify the number at this stage. But like we said, our aspiration continues to be to improve\\nour margin in the medium term.\\nBryan Bergin\\nOkay. And then my follow-up, I understand you have got a lot of questions here on the fiscal '24\\ngrowth outlook. Just trying to clarify maybe here and maybe tie all these questions together. Is it right\\nto say that at the low end of your '24 growth guidance, that you are assuming a worsening of volume\\nreductions and a worsening of decision-making pace for the balance of the year? And then at the\\nupper end, that the decision-making improves? Just trying to really get to the point of are you\\nassuming more of the same in the improvement or further deterioration, within this range?\\nSalil Parekh\\nThere, the way we have constructed this guidance, we see that, there is a change or a difference in\\nthe environment, in the decision-making. We have seen some of the impact in some of the industries\\nthat we shared earlier. And we will see how that volume, discretionary work translates itself over\\ntime. So we baked in some range of possibilities into that. We wanted to see how those possibilities\\nplay out.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Bryan Bergin\\nThank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please go ahead.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nYeah. Hi, good evening. Thanks for the opportunity. So Nilanjan, the employee headcount is down\\n3% over the last two quarters, but the absolute employee cost is up 2%. So what explains that\\ndynamic?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYeah. So like I said, this time, we have about 90 bps of impact, we do not see the entire thing in\\nemployee cost because even third-party costs have come down. But if you see about 90 basis points,\\nactually more than 120 basis points and then 90 basis points is actually in employee costs, variable\\npay is a big one, which we have upped consciously, in this quarter, a little bit of promotion, then there\\nare other balancing items.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nYeah. So, just a clarification there. So in the context of the deteriorating environment and attrition\\nsort of falling, the assumption was that employee cost would be something relatively easier to\\nmanage. And obviously, because the performance, company-wide performance itself is lower, the\\nvariable also should be lower. So what is driving the dynamic on higher variable pay and the\\ncompensation?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo we look at this holistically. And we do not look at just one quarter and decide these decisions. We\\nare looking at the overall environment and attrition, etc, and that is a decision we collectively take. It\\nis just not on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\\nWe have enough headroom in our utilization to grow volumes. And therefore, the attrition, which we\\nsee is not entirely replaced by lateral hiring. A part of that happens through lateral hiring, and we\\ncontinue to re-skill and move up our fresher bench and rotate people through projects. So that\\nbenefit, we continue to get.\\nAnd like I said, the 70 bps benefit, which we are seeing is coming partly because of improved\\nutilization.\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Nitin Padmanabhan\\nSure. And lastly, the $2.1 bn deal that we announced, in which vertical is that? If you could clarify\\nthat would be helpful?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nNo, we do not mention that on what vertical it is.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nOkay, sir. Thank you so much all the very best.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nThank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities. Please go\\nahead.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nYeah, hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, Salil, two questions from my side. One\\non the harping on the guidance part again. I mean, for long, I think, the guidance that Infosys gives\\nis kind of seen a benchmark for the industry and a lead across for the entire sector as well. And the\\nsharp cut that we had at this time. So just wanted to understand, the putting on hold of discretionary\\nspend and other issues that you mentioned that caused us to lower the guidance, do you see that\\nas a very Infosys specific thing, or do you see it more of an industry across the board that maybe\\nother companies are not seeing it right now, they might be following suit in the next few quarters. Or\\nis it something in the nature of our portfolio because of which you probably feel that it was cyclical?\\nI mean, in the last three months, because the other companies that have reported, there might not\\nhave been such number difference in the guidances. But the kind of $600 mn shock that we have\\nseen, we have not seen that kind of a change in commentary over the past three months by any\\nother player per se. So would you like to basically give some colour on how readable is this\\nenvironment, that has caused this deterioration to us and not to the other companies in the sector or\\nthe industry?\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Salil Parekh\\nSo there, my sense is, if you look at our Q1 number, we have 1% quarter-on-quarter growth, which\\nfrom what I have seen across the industry is, maybe one of the strongest quarter-on-quarter growth.\\nWe have a clear view of what we see as we have been discussing on large and mega deals, giving\\nus a strong growth orientation later in the year with some discretionary work, which is slowing in Q1.\\nSo I do not have a sense for the other players. That is how we see it. And if I look at Q1, we have a\\ngood outcome in terms of a solid quarter and looking at the industry, maybe higher growth Q-on-Q\\nthan many others.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nGot it. And in terms of conversations with the clients, just a follow-up on that, in terms of the\\nconversations with the clients, I think you mentioned it before on the call as well. What is the overall\\ngeneral conversation like, when they put this discretionary part of the deals on hold? I mean, do they\\nwant to do it, given the weak macro at this point of time? Is there any rethinking on the part of whether\\nthey need this kind of spend at all? Are those original decisions being questioned itself to begin with?\\nWhat exactly is the nature of the conversation with the clients, which are putting these spends on\\nhold?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo here, what we have seen is, again, in the industries, we referenced before, whether it is financial\\nservices or telco or hi-tech, the clients or the industries are going through a difficult environment\\nthemselves in the macro. They are looking for help or support from their partners like us, where they\\nput some projects, which they perceive to be not immediately relevant for them on a pause or\\nslowing. Those are the discretionary works that slow down. And we will see as the environment\\nchanges, what happens there.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nGot it. Great. Thanks for taking my question. And wish you all the best for the rest of the year.\\nModerator\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that would be our last question for today. I now hand the\\nconference back to the management for their closing remarks. Thank you, and over to you.\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

In summary, for\\nus, really, we have had a solid Q1, very good Q-on-Q growth, solid margins, excellent large deals\\nand mega deal wins. This sets us up very nicely, with some of the delays and the volume slowing\\nmore for the later part of the year. We have also got incredible traction in generative AI with 80\\nprojects and the Topaz work resonating with clients.\\nWe now put in place a stronger program on margin expansion, which is in play. Putting all of that\\ntogether, we see this is a year, where we will make that difference translating to mega deals and\\nlarge deals, and as we come towards the later part of the year, showing the realization of all of those.\\nSo thanks again, everyone, for joining in, and look forward to catching up at the next quarterly call.\\nModerator\\nThank you very much, members of the management.

Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining the call.\\nQ2 revenue growth was 2.5% year-on-year in constant currency. Sequentially, revenues grew by\\n2.3% in constant currency and 2.2% in dollar terms. While we saw continued softness in underlying\\nvolumes, revenue for the quarter was supported by stronger growth in the balanced portfolio and\\nimproved realizations from one-timers.\\nH1 revenue growth was 3.3% in constant currency terms and operating margins were at 21%, which\\nis the midpoint of our guidance range.\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

I will talk about it in more details later.\\nAs announced in the previous quarter, we have launched Project Maximus, which is a margin\\nimprovement plan across five pillars and over 20 tracks. This program has been well received across\\nthe organization, and we have been able to identify several new opportunities across the pillars. We\\nhave also seen some early benefits in some areas like utilization and optimization of overheads. We\\nremain confident that this program will create a more meaningful impact on operating margins in the\\nfuture.\\nOperating margins for Q2 were 21.2%, an increase of 40 bps sequentially, bringing H1 margins to\\n21%. Increase in operating margin sequentially was due to 0.5% from cost optimization benefits,\\ncomprising of higher utilization, pricing, etc., 0.3% from revenue one-timers, 0.1% from rupee\\ndepreciation, offset by 0.5% increase due to third-party cost, salary related and other items.\\nClient metrics remained strong with a number of $50 mn clients increasing to 80 and $100 mn clients\\nat 39, reflecting our strong ability to mine top clients by providing them multiple relevant services.\\nWe are rolling out FY '24 compensation hikes for employees effective November 1. Headcount at\\nthe end of the quarter stood at 328,000 employees, a decline of 2.2% from the previous quarter.\\nOur focus on improving operating efficiencies has resulted in an improvement of utilization, excluding\\ntrainees, from 81.1% to 81.8%, which we believe has further room for optimization. LTM attrition for\\nQ2 reduced further to 14.6%, while quarterly annualized attrition was flat sequentially. Free cash\\nflow for the quarter was robust at $670 mn and the conversion to net profit for Q2 was robust at 89%.\\nOur unbilled revenues dropped for the second consecutive quarter and consequently, this has partly\\nled to an increase in DSO by four days sequentially to 67.

Q2 growth was impacted\\nby spend reduction in some large clients, which was partially offset by ramp-ups of large deal wins\\nin areas like cost optimization and vendor consolidation.

In energy, spending remains cautious due to the economic slowdown with\\nfocus on cost takeout and ROI.

We retain our margin guidance band for the year at 20% to\\n22%.\\nWith that, we can open up the call for questions.\\nModerator\\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. The first question is from\\nthe line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.\\nBryan Bergin\\nHi, good evening, thank you. So I wanted to just start with the growth guidance reduction. And I am\\ntrying to understand if the reduction is more due to the delay of the large deal ramps versus what\\nyou had expected three months ago? Or if it is more due to incremental volume cuts and other\\nprogram efficiencies?\\nSalil Parekh\\nHi, thanks for the question. This is Salil. I think it is a combination of those points. There is a way\\nlarge programs start off, there is delays in starting them. The closing cycle was also a bit longer as\\nwe were signing these deals. So that had a bit of slowness. And we are seeing discretionary spend\\nwhich is coming down and we saw that continuing on transformation programs being slow, that is\\nalso continuing on in this quarter. So, it was a combination of those points.\\nBryan Bergin\\nOkay. I appreciate the color. And then just on margin, on an understanding you have the wage\\nincrements that you have just announced here but you also have margin tailwinds through Project\\nMaximus, so, can you give us some color on where you are finding comfort within the margin range\\nthat you refer to here today? So I know you are roughly at the midpoint through the first half. Do you\\nexpect to be above or below that as you go through the second half?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So like I said, we had a good quarter 2. And as I explained in my margin walk, we nearly had a\\n50 basis points improvement from our project Maximus on cost optimization. And that gives us\\ncomfort for the rest of the year and of course a much longer program, which will take not only into\\nthis year into next year as well. We also realize that we have apparent inefficiencies. Our utilization\\nis still low. So these will go and help us and, of course, offset the wage hikes, etc.\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'So we have a good program over the next 18 months to see where we end up. And of course, our\\naspirations continue to be that to improve margins from where we are presently.\\nBryan Bergin\\nThank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Kawaljeet Saluja from Kotak. Please go ahead.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nHi, thank you. I have a couple of questions. My first question is that can you quantify the revenue\\none-timers? And are these revenue one-timers in third-party items bought for service delivery to\\nclients or those are separate?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSee, in the margin walk, we have talked about 30 basis points impact on margin from revenue onetimers. So it is going to be around that figure or slightly more than that. So, these are largely items\\nthat will fall through straight to margin. What is the second part, Kawal?\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nOkay. The second part of the question is that can you detail out the verticals to which the mega deals\\nbelong? And the other question related to the deals is that normally, you expect the direction of\\nrevenue growth and deal wins to synchronize, whereas actually, they are moving in the opposite\\ndirection. So what needs to change for the synchronization to happen again?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So Kawal, we do not give out which segments, the mega deals are falling under. The second\\npart was you are saying where will revenue and the large deal announcement synchronize, is that\\nthe question?\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nYes, yes, absolutely. I mean they seem to be moving in different directions. With the $7.7 bn\\nmega/large deal wins, you would have expected a happier picture on growth outlook, whereas things\\nseem to have changed there. So, what needs to change for the synchronization of growth and the\\ndeal wins to happen?\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"Nilanjan Roy\\nSure. So I think one is, of course, mega deals. As you know, post signing, they have a runway in\\nterms of, firstly, in some cases, they may have rebadging, so that is the time it takes, sometimes we\\nhave regulatory approval, so you cannot even do people transfer. And then, there is a transition\\nperiod. And then, post transition, there is a transformation element or a run. So these are all steps\\nin the process. And as you can imagine, being such large deals, these cannot be turned on and\\nturned off, if we are taking over the entire landscape, etc, they have to be planned through entirely.\\nTherefore, it takes a couple of quarters before they start building into the revenue figures. And like I\\nsaid, this will set us up well for FY '25 fundamentally. And as Salil said, in the near term, in the\\nquarter, there is, of course, the underlying volume sluggishness. And we have to recognize that part\\nas we build in our forecast for this year.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nOkay, what is the deal pipeline like after the recent conversion of pipeline into a mega deal? So how\\ndoes the pipeline look like? I mean, is it significantly lighter, or does it stay remarkably strong?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nIt is a strong pipeline, with $7.7 bn this quarter, I think it cannot be higher than the previous quarter,\\nbut it is a very strong pipeline. And we will continue to have enough in the funnel to start refilling this.\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nOkay. Just a final question on deals. I think the past experience of mega deals and the transition of\\nthat into profitability has not been very encouraging. But if I look at your comments and Salil's\\ncomments, all of you have highlighted that your profitability aspiration is to improve your profit, you\\nwant to improve your profitability. Now at the same time, you have those mega deals as well. So how\\ndoes the profitability dynamics play out, especially given the past context?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo Kawal, as you know better than anybody else, when we set out the large deal strategies more\\nthan five years back, we were close to about 21% margin. We have signed probably $50 bn plus of\\nlarge deals. And today, we are at 21%, 21.2%. So, we have not seen any margin erosion because\\nof the large deal strategy, right. We recognize over all these periods and this experience which we\\nhave, we will sign on these large deals. Of course, upfront, they will have margin pressures. And\\nfrom a portfolio perspective, as you look in the deal tenures, we have our experience to say how we\\ncan improve the margin of the deal from day one versus, say, in year five.\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"And in a way, that is the portfolio we are able to rotate, go and get deals. At the same time, with our\\ncost optimization programs, make these deals approach portfolio margins. And I mean, the proof of\\nthe pudding is in the eating, $50 bn of large deals later, our margins are where they were.\\nClarification: Operating margin guidance for FY 19 when the large deal strategy was announced was\\n22-24%, as mentioned in earnings release on April 13, 2018\\nKawaljeet Saluja\\nOkay, sure. Thanks, thanks a lot.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go\\nahead.\\nMoshe Katri\\nHey, thanks and congrats on very strong TCV bookings for the quarter. So, if we are trying to kind of\\nfigure out the conversion pace of some of those large deals that I mean, I guess at this point, it\\nseems that we have not seen a lot of that conversion happen, but when do we start seeing that\\nreflected in better top line growth? Is the March quarter next year is the quarter or we could actually\\nsee better top line growth because of those conversions? Is that the right way looking at it?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So, there are a number of deals in this pipeline. Some will start in Q4, some which we signed\\nlast quarter have already started coming, a bit of that into Q3. So, it is not like one day, we suddenly\\nhave these 21 deals, which have rebids inside. So, they are phased. And in terms of even ramp-ups,\\nyou will see it is not that you hit the run rate on the day of the revenue booking, right, some of them\\ntake a longer period. So, it is a combination of all that.\\nMoshe Katri\\nOkay. And just to be clear, these are deals that are funded with the calendar '23 budget, you do not\\nneed calendar '24 budget to continue funding these deals. Is that the right way of looking at it as\\nwell?Salil Parekh\\nSorry, can you repeat that? I could not hear that, Moshe.\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

I just want to\\nconfirm that. i.e., you do not really need the approval of Calendar '24 budgets to continue funding\\nthese deals, is that the right way of looking at it?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So, they have already come out of existing budgets, but many of these are actually cost takeout\\nprograms in this environment, right, vendor consolidation, cost takeout. So actually, we are giving\\nmoney back in a way to the organization which is why in a way we are winning these deals.\\nMoshe Katri\\nYes. Good. And then the final question. Do you have any view, maybe Salil can talk about that, about\\ncalendar '24 budget cycle that probably should start maybe by next month. Do we feel that the budget\\ncycle is going to be on time? Do you think there is going to be budget delays, which is what happened\\nearlier this year? What are you seeing at this point based on some of the client conversations that\\nyou are having? Thanks a lot.\\nSalil Parekh\\nThanks. The way we are seeing the client conversations today, we do not see a change that has\\ncome about. There is a lot of constraints with clients, whether it is on transformation programs or\\ndiscretionary projects, which are significantly reduced or slowed down. So that thinking is continuing\\non. As you pointed out, over the next few weeks, we will get a better sense if that is changing, either\\nimproving or not for the following year.\\nBut at this stage, that is the mindset we are seeing. And there is an attention on cost and efficiency,\\nwhich also continues as we are in discussion. So, the conversations that we have been having over\\nthe last few months is the same tone we see as they go into the end of the year for next year's\\nbudgeting. We do not see a change in that at this stage.\\nMoshe Katri\\nUnderstood. Thank you.\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Moderator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\\nKumar Rakesh\\nThank you. So Salil, my first question was around the volume performance during the quarter. You\\ndid talk about that it is under pressure in last quarter also, you had talked about it. So, during the\\nquarter, how the volume performance you saw through the quarter? Was it further deteriorating since\\nwhere we saw last quarter? And is your guidance implying that there would be further deterioration\\noutside of the seasonality in coming two quarters?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, I did not share the volume specifics, I mentioned that there was continued constraints or pressure\\non that. What is happening, if you step back a little bit is, there is impact on revenue, which is from\\nslowing or stopping of discretionary work and the transformation programs. And then we have, on\\nthe other hand, with the large and mega deals, some of those starting off, that giving us a benefit on\\nthe revenue side.\\nSo there we saw the volume constrained from the first part of that in this quarter. In the coming\\nquarters, you know that, we will have in Q3, the usual seasonal impact with the end of the calendar\\nyear, holidays and so on. And typically, for us, for Infosys, Q3 and Q4 are softer quarters in any case.\\nSo, we anticipate that. We do not have a view which is different from that. That is how we are looking\\nat it going in. But these things are changing as we go through each quarter.\\nSo we were fortunate, we delivered a very strong quarter, but as we look out, we can see the\\npressures with the clients. And that is what gives us the reason to be watchful on both those sides.\\nKumar Rakesh\\nThanks for that. My second question was during the press conference, you did talk about that Infosys\\nis working on proprietary large language models. So, clarification is, are these models that you are\\nworking on, Infosys’ own or these are for clients or your ecosystem partners? And what kind of\\nmodels, use cases and dataset you are using for them?\\nSalil Parekh\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"So there, what I was referring to was proprietary models from our partners. So, we are not developing\\na large language model of our own. As you know, there are a large number of these models, which\\nare already in the market. Some of them are proprietary, and some of them are open source. We\\nare working with both types of those models.\\nTypically, we are working in what is called the narrow transformer approach, where we start to see\\ndatasets, which are a little bit more enterprise focused, which allow enterprise, large clients to take\\nadvantage of that dataset for their own activity. And the applications, again, you have probably seen\\nthat. We are seeing applications on software development, on text, on voice, on video. So, we are\\nseeing applications today on all of these areas and are actually working on all of these areas. And\\nthat is for the clients. we are doing some work inside Infosys as well for our own activities.\\nKumar Rakesh\\nGot it. Thanks. That is very helpful.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities. Please go\\nahead.\\nSandeep Shah\\nYes. Thanks for the opportunity. The first question is Nilanjan, in your opening remarks, you\\nmentioned that the mega deal wins and the robust order book signing will help us to accelerate the\\ngrowth beyond FY '24. So is it fair to say, most of the deal wins of this year will have a solid support\\nin terms of the growth pick-up in FY '25?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. I mean, these will translate into revenue one day. So, like I said, they will start in FY '25 and like\\nsomebody else also asked and we answered before, it is not like on one sudden day, they all start\\ntogether. So, they will have a run up. But absolutely, some of them will start even sooner in FY '24\\ntowards the fag end.\\nModerator\\nSandeep, is your question answered? Thank you. We move to the next question. That is from the\\nline of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please go ahead.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Yes. Hi, good evening and thank you for the opportunity. I had two questions. So, one is on\\ndiscretionary spends. As yesterday, I think, your peer had mentioned that they do not think\\ndiscretionary spends recover even in 2024. Just wanted your thoughts on how are you thinking about\\nthis, overall?\\nAnd in the context of this, well, we have seen very strong deal wins this time around. And obviously,\\nthose are deals that would have been under the hood for maybe the last 12 months, which have all\\nclosed. When you look at it going forward, do you think that deal activity per se, could sort of slow\\ndown, is there a risk there? Or if you could give some context in terms of pipeline versus how it was\\nbefore these deals closed? And how is it today? Is there a lot of replenishment that needs to be done\\nto reach back to the same level? That is the first question.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, on the first part, we do not have a view on financial year '24 in terms of volume and so on. What\\nwe are sharing today is, what we have seen, for example, in Q2 and what we observed from that\\nkeeping in mind some of the seasonality of this coming quarter and the end of our financial year.\\nOn the pipeline or deal activity, as Nilanjan was sharing, we see a good pipeline. Of course, the deals\\nwe have closed have come out of the pipeline. But it is still a good pipeline for us. There is a lot of\\ninterest from clients in cost and efficiency and automation, which is where many of these large and\\nmega deals have come in. There is a good interest in consolidation, which is where some of those\\ndeals have come in. And we continue to gain market share in that. So, we feel good about it. And\\nthere is that continuing interest in that type of work.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nSure. The second question was the underlying assumption on the guidance, if I understand right, is\\nthat the revenue accretion from these large deals will be very miniscule this year, and you have\\nheadwinds on the discretionary side. The bigger accretion should really happen maybe next year.\\nSo this year is very miniscule. That is a very fair assumption?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. The definition of miniscule can vary and can be quite different. But yes, I mean, it is more largely\\nin FY '25, absolutely.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Yes. So, I meant on a quarterly run rate basis, would it be miniscule of that coming into the revenue\\nversus what you originally thought? That was the context.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nSure. Fair enough. And lastly, in terms of the headwinds on discretionary, which verticals really stand\\nout in terms of where you are seeing the maximum pressure? That is the last question. Thank you.\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. I think, as we mentioned the three verticals, I think, you can see it both sequentially. You can\\nsee it year-on-year. You can see it with the peer group. It is financial services, it is mortgage, it is\\nasset management, it is parts of retail, it is communication. And I do not think, we are any different\\nfrom any of our peers. Everybody is calling out that these three verticals have been soft.\\nNitin Padmanabhan\\nSure. Fair enough. Thank you so much. All the very best.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Vibhor Singhal from Nuvama Equities. Please go\\nahead.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nYes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Salil, just two questions from my side. As we started the year\\nwith a guidance of 4% to 7% for FY '24, and we basically downgraded the guidance, second time\\nthis time around. So, in the last callyou had mentioned that, maybe in the first guidance, there were\\nsome assumptions which did not play out, and we had a fair bit of conservative numbers into the 1%\\nto 3.5% guidance which we had given last time.\\nSo, I just want to understand that we have been winning good deals all along, especially in this\\nquarter, and as you mentioned that some of the deals are taking time, so, what has changed from\\nthe time that we gave the first guidance to this time, in terms of the projects that we have already\\nthere in existence. Is that discretionary part of that, which is being put on hold much longer than\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'anticipated? Is there any one single or a couple of large projects which has kind of stopped\\ncontributing the amount that we had expected? Any color on that would be really helpful.\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, there is no one project or one specific client that is where this is coming from. I think, as we look\\nat each quarter, we look at the combination of the two streams on discretionary work and on digital\\ntransformation and other programs. How that is slowing down, where it is slowing down, what the\\nvolume implications are. And then we look at how the large and mega deals are coming into the\\nrevenue stream.\\nAs we look out, when we see changes in the discretionary work or we see some slowing down of\\ndecision-making for closing deals or slowing down in the start of ramp up, those are the factors that\\ncome into play as we look at the revenue outlook. And then as we come into this time of the year,\\nespecially, we look at the seasonality in Q3 and Q4 and how the thinking is in the client buying\\nenvironment. So that is really the combination of things that we do. There is not any one activity\\nwhich has led to that change for us.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nGot it. Any specific pockets of weakness which you have seen deteriorate at a much sharper rate\\nthan anticipated? It could be maybe vertical-wise or maybe a specific domain, let us say, cloud\\nadoption, or any other domain, or is it across the board?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo, the way we see in terms of industries, we have a similar sort of view from last quarter, the ones\\nthat Nilanjan outlined within financial services, mortgages, asset management, if you look at Hitech,\\ntelco, some parts of retail. So those are the ones. We have not seen any sort of dramatic changes\\nin that, but those are the ones where we see the impact.\\nVibhor Singhal\\nGot it. Sure, great. Thank you so much for taking my questions and wish you all the best.\\nModerator\\nThank you.

              "  'Yes, thanks for the opportunity. Nilanjan, just one question in terms of the third-party bought-out\\nitems that seems to have added almost ~$75 mn this quarter. So do you see this item sustaining or\\nit kind of falls off? And is this one of the reasons for your weak guidance?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo like I said, this is sometimes integral to our strategy as well because we are doing large-scale\\ntransformations and sometimes they have elements of licenses or software, hardware inside. And\\ntherefore, our guidance takes into account both volumes and any of non-headcount portfolio as well.\\nAshwin Mehta\\nOkay, okay. And in terms of wage hikes next quarter, what is the impact on margins that you see or\\nthe quantum of wage hikes that you are giving out?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo, we have rolled it out. We cannot say what is going to be the impact, but it is like we said, it is\\neffective 1st, of November.\\nAshwin Mehta\\nOkay. Fair enough and all the best.\\nModerator\\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley. Please go\\nahead.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nHi, thanks for taking my question. First one is that, does your guidance factor in the current\\nenvironment remaining similar in the next two quarters, or it further deteriorates from here because\\nit is kind of implying a decline sequentially over the next two quarters? So just trying to understand,\\nwhat is the underlying assumption on the current environment.\\nSalil Parekh\\nI think the way we are looking at the guidance is, typically, Q3 and Q4 are seasonally weaker\\nquarters. So that is something we factored in, in addition to what I was sharing earlier, the slowing\\nof discretionary transformation and with the large and mega deals, seeing how the ramp-up will look\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  \"like as it converts. But we have looked at more, what we see seasonally weaker Q3 and Q4 from our\\nhistorical perspective.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nSecondly, you closed a couple of mega deals in the last few months. Now when you look at your\\nlarge deal pipeline, how do you characterize this? Do you still have mega deals that you are pursuing,\\nwhich can close in the coming months?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there we have closed four of these mega deals that I referenced earlier. We have a good pipeline.\\nWe are not detailing beyond that, the type of deals. What we see is, the deals that we have closed\\nhave come off, but there is a huge appetite with clients for cost and efficiency. And those tend to be\\nlarger within even our large deals pipeline. So yes, we will see some of those larger deals going\\nahead there.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nGot it. Last question to Nilanjan that the Project Maximus that you talked about. Is it fair to say that\\nthe full benefit would accrue to the company in fiscal '25 and it just started to kind of trickle into the\\nnumbers in recent quarter, but the full benefit will accrue in FY '25?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nIt is a very complex program. There are a number of tracks. So we have new ideas as we see each\\nquarter. You will see an impact over maybe 18 months of this program and throughout as we are\\ntracking it every quarter. Sometimes you will see a faster benefit like utilization, for instance, there is\\nclearly something which is here and now. So you will see some of that impact even faster, but some\\nof course, take longer to materialize.\\nGaurav Rateria\\nThank you.\\nModerator\\nThank you.

              "  'Yes, absolutely. So you have mentioned a few times that discretionary spend or discretionary\\nprojects are a reason for the revenue guidance and reporting. Can you tell us what percent of your\\nrevenues would you characterize as being sourced from discretionary areas? Is it 30% of total\\nrevenues, 40% of total revenues? Any rough estimate you could give us on how much of your\\nrevenues are generated from discretionary sources?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So we do not really give that number out in public domain. So I think that is where we are. Of\\ncourse, generally, we have fixed price projects where we are more committed and T&M side of the\\nhouse which will have a bit of variability into it. But we do not give the discretionary really.\\nKeith Bachman\\nOkay. The second question is the $7.7 bn large deal TCV, within that number, do the clients have\\nthe ability to cancel those contracts? And if it is yes, what is the cancellation rate been over the last\\nfew quarters versus historic norms?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nThese are largely signed contracts. They take time to ramp up. So we have not seen any real\\ncancellations really. They may take longer to ramp up than originally envisaged, but there are no\\ncancellations really.\\nKeith Bachman\\nOkay. Fair enough. Perfect. And then my last question is, as you think of Infosys, TCS and Accenture\\nand other IT services organization are experiencing challenges with growth. So it is an industry-wide\\nissue. Against that backdrop, when you think about pricing that your clients are willing to accept,\\nhave you seen any changes in like-for-like pricing, when you are negotiating with clients for large\\ndeals or otherwise, has that changed at all? Or is the like-for-like pricing remain fairly steady even in\\nthis weak macro backdrop?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes, I think you are right. I think largely, it has been stable. Of course, in some quarters, you can see\\nfew clients are coming back and asking for discounts. But I think, overall, even if I look back, it has\\nbeen in terms of the annual renewals etc., I think pricing has been more stable over the last year or\\ntwo years as a general trend, I would think, in the industry. Of course, deal-to-deal, yes, it gets\\ncompeted hard. But overall, I do not see a deteriorating pricing environment.\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

Please go ahead.\\nYogesh Agarwal\\nYes. Hi guys. Just one question on large deals, which have been extraordinary, almost 2x, 3x of your\\npast run rate. I was curious, what is the share of large deals from existing customers versus new?\\nCan you just give some context there?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, again, we shared the net new amount, which is 48%, but we do not share what is from new\\nclient versus not new client.\\nYogesh Agarwal\\nOkay. Sir, the reason I am asking is, it is very intriguing that clients are not spending on small\\ndiscretionary projects, but awarding such mega contracts. So, is it possible, since this year, everyone\\nis cautious, they are just clubbing a lot of smaller projects and awarding in larger deals, which means\\nnext year we will effectively have two years of catch-up on discretionary spend?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSome of these deals have been publicly announced. These large programs are many times a\\ncombination of cost or efficiency automation program, and sometimes there are programs, which\\ntake all of that, let us say, the saving that the client is likely to accrue and from that fund some\\ntransformation programs.\\nSo, these do not appear from our interactions to be a consolidation of smaller discretionary work.\\nThese are large independent programs. And that is why we feel, that in that space, this cost efficiency\\nspace which is really more active today , we seem to be gaining market share and that those with\\nthe way they are being set up and what we see, give us a good foundation for our future.\\nYogesh Agarwal\\nFair enough. Thank you so much, sir.\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

Salil, in fact, just on your comments that you just made, I just wanted\\nto get a sense of the market share gains that you have been talking about currently because of these\\nlarge deal wins. Could you give us a sense of how these market share gains have been versus the\\npast? Are you seeing quite a bit of acceleration out there and how to think about it?\\nSalil Parekh\\nSo there, we are seeing more discussions on cost or consolidation. And for example, when you have\\na win as we have had over the last few quarters in consolidation of partners with a client, there is a\\nsignificant change that changes the market dynamic within that client. And then we put all of these\\nthings together between some of the large programs you run on cost efficiency and then on\\nconsolidation, it looks like we seem to be gaining traction. We have a very good capability set on\\nautomation and clients are appreciating that. So that seems to be the reason, why we believe or we\\nthink that it looks like, we are gaining market share in those areas.\\nVivek Gedda\\nBut is there a way to quantify, from the sense that are you seeing that client budgets are actually not\\nincreasing while you potentially are getting more deals versus what your pe\\n\\ner sets are?\\n\\nSalil Parekh\\nDifficult for us to say on a sort of macro level, but I think generally speaking, the client budgets at\\nleast we do not see those increasing at that this stage.\\nVivek Gedda\\nGot that. Secondly, I also wanted to get a sense of tenure of some of these large deals that you won\\nand in the context of, how it has been historically. So -it is probably logical to expect that these are\\nlong tenure deals.

Just lastly from my side, I just wanted to also get a sense on this third-party items bought\\nout which almost increased $75 mn. However, we called out that one-time revenue bump-up that we\\ngot was 30 basis points, which is relatively lesser than what we see here. Is that different items and\\nhow to think about that?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nAbsolutely. They are different items.

Thanks for taking my question. I was also trying to deconstruct this quarter's\\ngrowth. It seems to me there is a volume decline, just going by the headcount decline and small\\nincrease in utilization. So, is it the realization which has helped us or some of the one-time which\\nyou mentioned, and it has been asked in the previous questions also?\\nOr is it that some of the smaller deals, like less than $50 mn, which we do not disclose, the uptick in\\nthose deals or kind of inflow of those deals has kind of dried up significantly, which is basically\\nresulting in mega deals needed to sustain the volume growth?\\nNilanjan Roy\\n\\nExternal Document © 2023 Infosys Limited\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'So in my opening remarks, I said that we are continuing to see softness in the underlying volumes\\nand the revenue for the quarter was supported by stronger growth in the balanced portfolio and\\nimproved realization from one-timers.\\nAbhishek Kumar\\nOkay. So, my question also was, while I know we do not give the numbers out, but the contribution\\nof less than $50 mn deals in our revenue contribution or pipeline how has that changed? The reason\\nwhy I am asking is, it seems that without the mega deal or large deals ramping up, there is a\\nsustained pressure on margins. And these deals could be difficult to time, when really these deals\\nwill ramp-up. So, in the absence of that, the contribution smaller deals, has that really kind of changed\\nas a proportion of revenue over the last few quarters?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nSo, we do not give out this information.\\nAbhishek Kumar\\nSure.

It is been down 5% over the past three quarters\\nwith utilizations that have been flat. So how should we expect that to play?\\nNilanjan Roy\\nYes. So, you have to triangulate across volume, attrition, new hiring and utilization. The broad\\nmessage is that even with the utilization increase today to 81.8%, we still have headroom to improve\\nthe utilization further. So that should give you a sense of things to come. And of course, we continue\\nto monitor overall volumes, etc., so there is enough headroom and this is helping us in margins, like\\nI said at the beginning, right?

The top line got impacted due to strict battery\\ncompliance norms, which was introduced by Government of India, which has resulted in the\\ndeliveries getting deferred. However, we are pleased to inform you that we have received\\nthe battery compliance certification for all the models now. We have delivered on a\\ncumulative basis more than 1250 buses till 30th June 2023. We remain committed to\\ncontributing towards a clean mobility agenda of the country and look forward to a strong\\ngrowth trajectory in the coming quarters and years. So I would request for the Q&A session.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. We\\nhave the first question from the line of Bala Murali Krishna from Oman Investment\\nAdvisors. Please go ahead.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nGood evening and congratulations on great set of numbers. So regarding the guidance of\\n1200 buses for the FY2024, we have delivered only around 75 buses in this quarter.\\n\\nPage 2 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nIs it possible to meet the guidance and what could be the margins level we can expect on\\noverall yearly basis?\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier in my introductory message, we have just received the certification\\nnorms which was introduced by the Government of India and we are very pleased to obtain\\nfor all the models and we are striving to cover the backlog. In Q3, Q4 we are trying to the\\nmake up the shortfalls which happened in Q1. As far as margins are concerned, we are\\nexpecting on overall higher volumes, the margin in terms of percentage will be about 10 to\\n12% and in terms of value, it is going to go up.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nOkay understood and regarding that order book, we have around 8000 buses order book\\nwhich is supposed to get executed within the two years or before that. Do you think it is\\npossible to complete this order book in the next two years because we have a facility of\\n1500 as of now and next year maybe we may add 5000 facility, but the utilization levels\\nwill be low in this facility so is it possible to complete this order book by FY2025?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee we have a timeline of 12 to 24 months and I am talking about the various orders and the\\nnew facility is expected to come in the Q4 and with the addition of the new facility, we are\\nconfident of completing the orders in 24 months.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nRegarding the E Tripper, so last quarter we had executed order of parent company.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs of now we have been doing extensively trials and demos in various project sites and\\nconstruction and mines, so the trials have been very good. So the traction is likely to happen\\nin the coming quarters. The response has been positive so we expect the private orders\\ncoming in the next quarters.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nLastly last time we have spoken about 10,000 buses tender which is in progress out of that\\nwe have received this 5000 order from Maharashtra and what about the balance tenders is it\\nconcluded or it is still pending.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nBalance are in advantage stage of conclusions? So there are at various stages of conclusions.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nAnd we can hope for order win in that tender also.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAnd the other positive in the current quarter is the BEST order, which has come in our\\nfavor.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nCould you please give a breakup of that 5000 balance tenders from which state and how\\nmuch it is?\\n\\nPage 3 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

You are talking about the new tenders.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nSorry to interfere. I am talking about the tenders which we are supposed to get it. Thank\\nyou.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe have BEST about 3000 numbers and other various tenders are there. The major one is\\nthe BEST.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nThis is Bangalore.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nBEST Mumbai.\\n\\nBala Murali Krishna:\\n\\nOkay. Thanks a lot and all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Rakesh Jain. Please proceed.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nThank you for taking my question. You highlighted that there were some battery norms\\nwhich led to lower revenue. Could you provide more colour what were those norms and\\nwhat kind of impact it had and subsequently does it also impact the cost for you and second\\nquestion is given the size of orders which you are getting, how is the bidding at the moment,\\nwhat is leading to you being able to get such good incremental orders, how should we\\ninterpret the competitive scenario right now?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee as far as the first question is concerned, the Government of India has introduced the\\nsafety norms for all the electric vehicle segment especially the battery side because of some\\nincidents in the two wheeler segment. Because of this introduction of norms, so we have to\\ndo the testing and certifications. Unfortunately, we do not have the testing facilities in India,\\nso it has to be done on an online virtual basis from China and that is the reason it was taking\\nmore time and this is beyond our control. Now that we have completed all the tests and we\\nhave successfully got the certifications for all our models. Now coming to the second\\nquestion with regard to the competitive landscape, see about 50,000 buses tenders are being\\nproposed or planned by CESL. As far as we are concerned, see we have a strong product\\nand we have completed more than 12 Crores kilometers on Indian roads as we speak today\\nwith the delivery of more than 1250 buses. So we have a stronger product portfolio and our\\ntechnology is proven with which we are able to basically gain the customer confidence and\\nmeet the customer requirements. See from a technical point of view and even from a\\nfinancial point of view because the more kilometers you run on a single charge will\\ndefinitely give more contributions and our product again over a period of time last five\\nyears, seven years, we have been working in various different terrains and accordingly, we\\n\\nPage 4 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nhave been very competitive and we have been in terms of economics, highly efficient. So\\nwe have basically a reliable product in terms of range and in terms of quality in all the\\nparameters our product has been superior.\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nWhere I was coming from is I mean the size of order which we are getting is pretty high\\nrelatively so it some scenario where competitors are not able to bid at the price at which you\\nare coming or some competitors have exited the market and you usually provide what is the\\nbidding rate going on at the moment for the tenders you are biding in buses?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee all the new tenders are coming up without subsidy elements. So the rate per se versus\\nwithout subsidy is going slightly up. The kilometer it depends on again city to city,\\napplication to application. For inter city operations, obviously the more number of\\nkilometers is run so the rates are different. And for intra city based on city to city, the\\napplication varies. If there is a requirement to run 200 kilometers, the per kilometer rate is\\ndifferent from requirement to run 150 kilometer. So accordingly the rates will be anywhere\\nbetween Rs. 50 to 80 per kilometer.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nSure. Thank you so much Sir.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Rajesh VC an investor. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nRajesh VC:\\n\\nThank you for giving opportunity in this session as well. So just a couple of questions which\\nI would like to ask as an investor, so as you can see even though there is an improvement\\nfrom year to year in terms of the operating profit as well as net profit however from quarter\\nto quarter it has gone down so there is any particular reason for that because that is having\\nan impact on share prices also so that is number one and number two we also heard that I\\nthink in the past there was collaboration with Reliance for the hydrogen fuel powered buses\\nas well as ion charging stations so what is the development on those side and how will be\\nthe ratio in future in terms of hydrogen powered as well as EV powered buses? Thank you.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nComing to the business performance, quarter on quarter we have been doing very well both\\nin terms of top line and bottom line. As you see last six quarters, we have been doing very\\nwell so this quarter as I mentioned to you because of the introduction of these norms that\\nhas impacted. Other than that if you see the operating margins are maintained at healthy\\nlevels that is as far as your first question is concerned. Second question on the Reliance tie\\nup ,hydrogen we have developed the proto and it is a testing phase as this new technology is\\nnascent, it will take some more time for the product to come out in terms of\\ncommercialization. So today we cannot actually form any opinion or give any guidance\\nwith regard to what will be the ratio of hydrogen versus EV.\\n\\nPage 5 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

Thanks a lot.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe have the next question from the line of Gursharan from GMA Advisors. Please go\\nahead.\\n\\nGursharan:\\n\\nJust wanted to figure out about the fundraising activity. It is like pending since quite long.\\nWe were just having a look at Mahindra's like already without having started production,\\ntheir valuation is around $9 billion whereas we have claimed to be the largest manufacturer\\nof buses in the country, electric buses and our market cap is only 1 billion and they have\\nalready raised 1200 Crores without even starting production so where is the hitch? Where\\nare we stuck? Since last year, we have been mentioning every time on the call that yes, we\\nare expecting it to be done. Is there any hitch here?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think just to answer your question, we have been definitely working on raising funds for\\nequity because of the market was not conducive. As you will see right from January\\nonwards till August not many deals have happened on the QIP front okay and the market\\nhas been volatile and of course unless the market is stable, I think investors definitely would\\nlook forward to wait. We have clearly a mandate from the shareholders who have approved\\nit in the last AGM and the board. We still continue actually exploring the possibilities. In\\nthe interim since with the approval of shareholders, we have awarded the contract to MEIL\\nwhich is a L1 vendor for the construction of the plant. Now the plant construction activity is\\ngoing on. We have given the LOA on 19th July. MEIL with their reputation of turning\\naround turn key projects in quick turnaround, we are expecting in Q4 to start\\ncommencement of production in the new plant.\\n\\nGursharan:\\n\\nI wanted to figure out like the money we want to raise from the financial investors or from\\nstrategic investors.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee basically it is going to be private investment. We have basically taken approvals and we\\nare working hard for the QIP.\\n\\nGursharan:\\n\\nListen, what I was trying to figure out like type of investor which we are looking on\\ninvestment do you want financial investors or do you want strategic investors like we want\\nmoney from people who can give us technology who can be our shareholders for maybe\\nseveral years.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes we are looking for good profile for an institutional investors who will remain invested\\nlike for example in our portfolio we have Nomura, Jupiter, Black Rock, Goldman Sachs,\\nThey have been there for quite some time and we are looking for investors like them to\\ninvest into our portfolio and who will stay invested for a longer period of time.\\n\\nPage 6 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nGursharan:\\n\\nExactly you are looking out for financial investors only you are not looking for strategic or\\ntechnology investor.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\nGursharan:\\n\\nNo No.\\nOkay while you have successfully launched your tripper, I just want to understand are we\\nalso working on some heavy trucks etc also?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes, we are doing trials. Now for electric tripper it took more than a year for doing trials\\nand we are working on various product portfolio within the trucks and tripper segment.\\n\\nGursharan:\\n\\nOkay because Eicher has already launched though we are supposed to be leaders, we are\\nwondering like how come we stayed behind?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee we have already commercially launched last quarter itself. Commercially sold electric\\ntrippers and we are working on various products within the trucks and tripper segment and\\nour trials have been getting positive response and we are expecting good orders in the\\ncoming quarter.\\n\\nGursharan:\\n\\nOnly last question Sir. I wanted to figure out like should there be reason there be delays like\\nthis time we had impacted certification delay, earlier it was supply chain issues, now should\\nthere be delays and we not see deadlines of these tender will the penalties accrue on the\\ncompany. Are we confident enough that yes, we will meet all the deadlines and there will be\\nno penalty on the company.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think we have earlier discussed this aspect. What is happening is EV Buses in terms of\\noperational efficiency ,in terms of economics makes a huge sense for the STUs. So there has\\nbeen delay from both sides. Okay because from STU scope of work they have to create the\\nspace for depots and they have to get a power connection and from EVEY side we have to\\ndeliver the buses and build the charging infra. So we have now created good order book\\nnow we are creating capacity and we are confident of executing all the orders within the\\nnext 12 to 24 months.\\n\\nGursharan:\\n\\nThat is really encouraging. Thank you so much.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Smita Mohta from Kredent\\nInfoEdge. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nSo there are couple of questions. One is regarding the technological partnership that you\\nhave with BYD, with the recent problem that BYD not coming into and government not\\n\\nPage 7 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nallowing and your partnership finishing by FY2025 so do you think that technological\\nknowhow would be again restarted post FY2025. Are in you talks regarding the same.\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think we started our journey in 2015 with BYD and we have been working together and\\nwe have a very strong R&D team. Basically we have been working internally to create new\\nproduct portfolios, new products line and initially as you were aware we were dependent on\\nBYD as a technology partner. With very strong internal R&D team we have been\\ndeveloping and acquiring the knowledge transfer from BYD and BYD is definitely looking\\nforward to extend the relationship beyond 2025. So we have a very, very strong relationship\\nwith BYD and we are confident that these relationship will go beyond 2025.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nBut BYD wants to launch new products which is why they approached MEIL for the same\\nin which the government refused to allow BYD with MEIL to produce products in India so\\nregarding that if they are producing new products with you all with the technology transfer,\\nso then why are they looking for product launch by themselves in India and want to become\\na major player in India in this stream? So do you stand any chances of having problems in\\nfuture with BYD?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe are not foreseeing any problems as such because we are having a strategic tie up. We\\nare sourcing like all the OEMs battery cell and some critical components related to power\\ntrains. Other than this, we have localized majority of the components required for\\nmanufacturing the bus and as you are aware PLI scheme has been introduced by\\ngovernment of India and few Indian companies have started manufacturing batteries in\\nIndia. Definitely in 2-3 years time these companies will definitely be in a situation to supply\\nthe batteries and in terms of technology and in terms of cost, we are able to get from the\\nlocal Indian companies, we are open to actually buy source the batteries from Indian\\ncompanies.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nOkay got it. Sir one more thing you had said that for FY2024 your E buses expectation of\\nsale was 2500 and tippers 1200. So I would like to understand that with the current order\\nbook that you have, you said that your 12 metre buses has more margin than the 9 metre\\nbuses so as per the current order book which bus orders will you have more.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee basically it again depends on application of various cities and number of kilometers run.\\nSo in terms of the current order book we have more of 12 meters.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nOkay that is good.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nThe first question I was not very clear. What was your introductory message?\\n\\nPage 8 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nMy introductory question was that you have given a guidance of E buses and tippers which\\nwe can expect to be delivered by for FY2024 so which was 2500 and 1200 right.\\nE buses 2500 and tippers 1200.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think slight correction 1200-1500 buses/tippers is the guidance we have given for this\\nfinancial year, 2,500 is for the next financial year.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nOkay got it. So will you be able to exhibit this guidance?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe are striving to make up the shortfall of Q1 in Q3 and Q4 and we are striving to do 1200\\nbuses/ tippers.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nLastly Sir. MEIL did not put in any money. Instead you gave the order to the MEIL for the\\nconstruction of facility with which you will be able to do business from Q4 onwards so this\\norder that you have given to them worth earlier say around 400 Crores so where will that\\nmoney come from will it be internal accrual or you are looking out for any funding and if\\nyou looking out for it then what is the interest rate which you will be comfortable in getting\\nthat funding?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nBasically we are looking at internal accruals and maybe interim loans till the QIP is\\nfinalized and we expect the rate between 8 to 9% in case we go for a debt.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nOkay and which quarter can you says is best for your according to your business culture\\nhistorically and where do you see the competition because now even Hinduja is getting lot\\nof orders from the STUs for the buses and all so where do we see this competition headed?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nOur quarters if you see historically we have been doing very well in Q3 and Q4 and as far as\\ncompetitive landscape is concerned, there is enough space for everyone to come in because\\nhuge opportunity for the EV segment with the push from government of India and with the\\ncapacities all put together will not be able to meet the requirements as of today. So it again\\nboils down to the product technology and in terms of performance and all the parameters\\nlike the range, on a single charge how much kilometers we can run and in terms of\\noperational efficiencies. So there is enough space for everyone because the ecosystem in\\njust the EV segment in terms of buses is just taking off. Still we can say it is nascent in\\nIndia.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nI just wanted to know Sir where do you see yourself in this league five years down the line\\nat which number.\\n\\nPage 9 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe definitely strive to be the leader. We intend to have the leadership position in this\\nsegment.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nCurrently, what market share do you have Sir in the buses.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAbout 35%.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\n35.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSmita Mohta:\\n\\nThat is it from my side. Thank you very much.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Chethan Dhruva from Chethan\\nDhruva Investments. Please go ahead.\\n\\nChethan Dhruva:\\n\\nThanks for the opportunity. Sir one quick question and clarification that I needed was\\nregarding your guidance, right. So you had talked about 1200-1500 buses for this year and\\ncumulative of 8000 buses being your order book and that would be delivered in 12-24\\nmonths so I am assuming end of FY2025. So you are essentially saying that for next year\\nyou will be doing almost six and half thousand buses is that correct to understand.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nNext year we are targeting about 2500 buses.\\n\\nChethan Dhruva:\\n\\nBut then how will you meet the 8000 buses requirement in two years.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe are talking about spilling over into financial year 2025-2026. We have basically\\ntimelines to cover in 24 months from now. So, we are building the capacity. We will strive\\nto do more but on a conservative number we are saying 2500 numbers is minimum which\\nwe want to do next financial year.\\n\\nChethan Dhruva:\\n\\nBut that conservative number seems to be way of the market even if you assume spill over\\nAugust to August, two years still a big chunk has to be completed next year.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee basically if you talk about 8500, if you do 1200 this year and 2,500 by next year we will\\nhave about 4500 buses remaining.\\n\\nChethan Dhruva:\\n\\nRight and over three months by five months basically. So you are saying essentially there\\nwill be big ramp up in FY2026 initially itself?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAnd the capacity we are initially targeting 5000 which can be expandable to 10,000.\\n\\nPage 10 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nChethan Dhruva:\\n\\nOkay and you had also mentioned earlier that your current factory can also be run in\\nmultiple shifts, right? Because 1500 is just for one shift.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes correct.\\n\\nChethan Dhruva:\\n\\nSo you are not planning to increase any shifts or such plans to meet higher number of buses\\nfor FY2025, to produce higher number of buses.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes we will parallelly plan that also.\\n\\nChethan Dhruva:\\n\\nOkay so the way I am reading then two and half thousand is a very, very conservative\\nnumber. Okay thanks for that Sir. I think the other question I was on the BYD partnership\\nand you already clarified to the previous participant. So thank you for the time and good\\nluck for the future quarters.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Nihar Mamtura an investor. Please\\ngo ahead.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nI am just following up on the ability to deliver on to the order book because if I understand\\nthe order book is about 8000 buses. So how is that going to get staggered between current\\nfinancial year and the next two financial years.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think we have mentioned earlier about 1200 is what we are targeting to complete in this\\nfinancial year and the next financial year, minimum 2500 is what we are targeting and the\\nbalance, we would like to do it in 2025-2026 so that means 1200 now, 2500 and the balance\\nwill be about 5000 numbers will be in financial year 2025-2026.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nJust a following up question, if you get any other order then are you saying that the\\ncompany cannot supply anymore buses and everything is going to get pushed out to 20262027?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee we are working on now currently very less utilization of our capacity. So we can\\nbasically do 1500 in this plant on a single shift basis which can be increased. So if we get\\norders we can ramp up.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nSo if I just go with numbers, capacity numbers in the current year with the current plant\\nwhat is the capacity?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nCurrently plant we have a capacity of 1500 on a single shift.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nOn a single shift and it can become effectively 3000 on a double shift.\\n\\nPage 11 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nAugust 10, 2023\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nIt can yes 2500 to 3000. Basically any plant we can produce at about 80-85% efficiency so\\nwe cannot double on a mathematical calculation 1500 to 3000 so on 80% capacity or 8085% efficiency about 2500.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nOkay and what about the capacity for next year.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nNext year we will have a new plant coming in fully 5000 and based on the order book we\\ncan operate two plants.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nSo then would it be fair that see the current plant can produce about two and half thousand\\nbuses then next year once the new plant depending on which quarter it becomes operational,\\nso when is the new plant going to be operational.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nLast quarter this year we are targeting to start because we want to do in a granular manner.\\nWe are not waiting for the entire plant to be ready. As soon as we go in a granular shed\\nwise, once the assembly section is ready we can start parallelly working in both the plants\\nand again I want to repeat we want to be very conservative. We are building up capacity to\\nmeet and complete all the existing order book.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nSo fair enough and it is good to be conservative. The number then will be two and half\\nthousand from current plant and the new plant in the next financial year can probably give\\nabout 3000 to three and half thousand buses so effectively it can be about five and half to\\n6000 buses that our company can produce next year, the order book can be finished of next\\nyear.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nI know capex has been approved for the new plant but any other additional capex or high\\nticket expenses required to kind of get this going next year.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nNow once the plant is built we are building for 10,000 numbers and as far as the plant is\\nconcerned maybe balancing equipment will be required for adding the capacity so which\\nmay not be very significant which could in the region of 100 to 200 Crores.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nOkay and any risk because if there is any imported item and there could be restrictions if it\\nis coming from China do you anticipate any risk call out.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee we are basically gearing up. We are gearing up for that. That is the reason we have been\\nworking on localization and we have successfully developed local vendors for all the\\ncomponents except the battery cells where the entire industry is dependent, not only India\\nacross the globe, dependent on China, for the battery cell and some of the components\\n\\nPage 12 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

I mean from a manpower standpoint is it adequately available\\ntrained resources to cater for this demand or the expansion?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNihar Mamtura:\\n\\nOkay that is for me. Thank you so much and all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of the Madhusudhan Khaitan an\\ninvestor. Please go ahead.\\n\\nMadhusudhan:\\n\\nThere was a statement by your leading competitor they are not bidding for the STUs as\\nthere are payment issues therefore are just staying away from the STU space so what is your\\ntake on that?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee our experience is different. As far as the payment from STUs are concerned, it is not\\ngoing to impact Olectra because Olectra is in the business of manufacturing and selling the\\nbuses. The concessionaire or the bidder which owns the buses, operate the buses to STU\\nbasis on a per kilometer basis and as far as the concessionaire is concerned, the operating\\ncompany is concerned, their experience has been different, they have been able to collect\\nfrom the STUs about almost 80% within 60 days and 20% within 90 days. So I am not sure,\\nabout the competitor issues.\\n\\nMadhusudhan:\\n\\nOkay thank you Sir and wish you all the best.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you.

And finally what is our expansion plan\\non the insulator division because there also there has been a bit of a though the volumes are\\nstill less because it does not form a big chunk of your P&L and balance sheet but what are\\nour plans around it and then of course there has been a degrowth from the March quarter\\nthere also and is there also a dependency on the battery certification which you mentioned\\nearlier on the call.\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee as far as long term business plan is concerned, the TIV of bus industry is about 1.8\\nmillion and about almost 1 to 2 lakhs will be the requirement on a yearly basis and these are\\nthe expectations between next five years time and with these recent Government of India\\npolicy to scrap old vehicles actually beyond 15 years I think there is a huge opportunity as\\nyou have mentioned. There is a huge demand. Requirements will go up significantly. We\\nwould strive where we intend to be having a leadership position as far as electric vehicle\\nsegment is concerned. Because we are a pure electric company as against the competitors.\\nAs far as positioning as I mentioned to you, we want to be the leader in this space. And as\\nfar as Greenfield facility is concerned, we are already in the process of setting up the new\\nplant to meet the current order book and as per our understanding is concerned within 12-18\\nmonths a new plant can be set up.\\n\\nRajesh Pandey:\\n\\nOkay and what are our business plans around the insulator division. I did not really quite\\nunderstand exactly the product per se and how you want to kind of scale up that segment as\\nwell?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI just mentioned to you insulator segment is a niche segment. This is a technology again\\nintroduced by our company. This is a composite polymer based insulator against the\\nconventional porcelain. Mr. Rajesh, you had questions on the insulator segment, so I was\\nmentioning to you this insulator business is a niche business. We have introduced this\\ntechnology in the country. This is a composite polymer based insulators against the\\nconventional porcelain. The market is not unlimited. The market size is currently about 350\\nto 400 Crores and we have a market share about 35-40% and we have been focusing in the\\nrecent past on exports to a very large customer in US. And as of now the market is not\\nunlimited as I mentioned, so we will continue to positioning ourselves as a market leader in\\nthat segment as well.\\n\\nRajesh Pandey:\\n\\nOkay thanks very much.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThank you. We have the next question from the line of Anil an investor. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nHi good evening to you. See we have market share of 35% and we say that we are going to\\ndeliver in next to 24 months 8500 buses. And do you mean to say that next two years Indian\\n\\nPage 14 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

In that case then only we will be able\\nto maintain the market share otherwise I think the number what you are projecting as per in\\nline with the capacity or the delivery what we are seeing for the last two quarters or three\\nquarters or one year we are going to lose the market share very drastically.\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nTo answer your question, currently the market share is 25% on numbers when we say about.\\n10,000 odd buses and as we talk about 50,000 numbers, what I mentioned to you is we want\\nto have a leadership position. I am not talking about what is the percentage. We want to be a\\nmarket leader definitely having leadership position. As we talk about 50,000 numbers\\nobviously our market share will translate to about 12,500 numbers.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nI am just rephrasing my question. What I am saying is that if you are saying 25% market\\nshare is our target. If 25% is the market share is our target for next 2 years and which is\\nnothing but 8500 buses let us say 10,000 buses, India is going to witness in next 24 months\\nonly 40,000 buses that’s not going to be the market share. That’s not going to be the market\\nsize. I am saying about our plan. I am talking about our plan. Our plan is to just deliver\\n10,000 buses in next two years which means you mean to say India is going to witness only\\n40,000 of electric buses in next two years. There is mismatch in what India is going to\\nwitness the roll out of the buses and what we are building our capacity and what we are\\nplaning to deliver.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWhen we talk about our share if you convert that 40,000 buses obviously including all\\ncompetition today currently nobody has got that kind of landscape, the capacities and based\\non the necessity we will ramp up.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nMy question is very simple with a target saying that are we going to see that India is going\\nto witness only 40,000 buses roll out in next two years and we are going to contribute\\n10,000 buses in that and that is why we are going to have a 25% market. Is that the realistic\\nfigure what you are forecasting to us, is that clear.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee your question is basically market size will be more than 40,000 that is what you are\\nsaying in the next two years.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nYes. I am saying that average India will witness in the next one year or two years roll out of\\nat least one to two lakh of buses the kind of target which government has set for 2030 and if\\nthat is the market share of two lakh buses and we are going to deliver only 10,000 buses in\\ntwo lakhs market what we are building the capacity it is not in line with the opportunity\\nwhat we are going to witness?\\n\\nPage 15 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

First, we are talking about two\\nyears period so you are going to say that next two years India will witness only 40,000 bus\\nof EV and in that we are going to deliver 10,000 buses.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nCorrect you are right.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nAnd I think we are projecting very, very, conservatively. I think we are not in line with\\naggressiveness of the market which we are going to see in the next 2-3 years. My next\\nquestion is like recently government has rejected the BYD proposal based on security\\nconcern and which is a very, very big concern for all of us. So my question is what is\\nOlectra without BYD.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee as far as the proposal what India you are referring to is nothing to do with Olectra it is\\nnot related to electric buses right.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nThat is not right see it is a security concern. If we have a tie up in that kind of company in\\nany format in any company it is going to have its own impact what I am asking is what is\\nOlectra without BYD.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs we have already mentioned earlier we have been working on our own products. We have\\nbeen introducing new products and we have a very strong R&D team except for battery\\ncells and power train. We are not dependent on BYD. And the other aspect is Government\\nof India rejection is relating to FDI proposal it is not relating to securitization or anything. It\\nis a FDI proposal where they have rejected it but as far as we are concerned we are having\\nstrategic tie up with BYD and we are Sourcing all the materials in India except the battery\\ncells.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nCan we please what is the most critical equipment required for having world class bus to\\nroll out?

We have the next session from the line of Siddhant an investor. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSiddhant:\\n\\nGood evening Sir. Sir my first question is regarding the raw material cost. As a percentage\\nof shares this quarter it fell sharply so what was the reason for that.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nThe reasons for that is the product mix.\\n\\nSiddhant:\\n\\nBecause of that our margins were close to 19% and previously we were doing about 13 or\\n14%, so can you give us a guidance on sustainable margins.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee basically because of the revenue mix, the operating margins are much better than earlier\\nquarters, but as we have mentioned earlier on a sustainable basis the margins we are\\nexpecting between 10 to 12%.\\n\\nSiddhant:\\n\\nSir when you say that it is because of the revenue mix does it highlight that we sold more of\\nthe 12mm buses as compared to the 9mm.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nIt is basically on account of operating revenues also where we have higher EBITDA\\nmargins.\\n\\nSiddhant:\\n\\nOkay and Sir my second question in the last con call we had mentioned that because of the\\nbattery norms we could not push the sales of electric tipper so nothing was mentioned on\\nfront of the buses and this time we are hearing that it is because of the battery norms that we\\ncould not sell more electric buses so just some clarity on the whole scenario Sir. Exactly\\nwhat has happened and what is happening.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think electrical tippers we never mentioned about any battery norms.

Although there continues to be a supply chain\\nand the macro risks, our focus continues on increasing our manufacturing capacity and\\nenhancing our technology capabilities. This has helped us to maintain our leadership position in\\nthe electric vehicle segment and we intend to be the market leader in EV segment.\\nIn just 5 years since the delivery of first bus, Olectra has established itself as the leading E-bus\\nOEM and now firmly looking ahead for a bigger vision. We have delivered over 1,100 plus\\nelectric buses till 31st March 2023. Our business model has moved a long way in the last six\\nyears and proven profitable to the end customers. It has changed from a demand constraint to a\\nsupply constraint, and we are seeing the demand for the electric buses to be exploding.\\nAs you are aware, our Company has evolved from being part of a little known business enterprise\\nin 2017 to be now part of MEIL, which is one of the India's largest infra and engineering\\nCompany with more than 30 years of industry experience with a turnover of $3.4 billion and it\\nis an AA rated Company.\\nOur order book, as we stand as on 31st March after delivering 563 electric buses is at 3,394. We\\nare pleased to share our shareholders that our Company received the CMVR and Homologation\\ncertificate and started to sell electric tippers in Quarter 4, and we are the first Company to register\\n\\nPage 2 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

We remain committed to contributing towards the clean\\nmobility agenda of the country and look forward to a strong growth trajectory in the coming\\nyears.\\nI would like to now give a detailed presentation on the financials:\\nOur Company has achieved excellent growth in Quarter 4 and full year. And the key highlights\\nfor Quarter 4 and full year standalone financials is as follows. Our revenue for Quarter 4 is at\\nRs. 368.4 crores as against Rs. 268.1 crores, up by 37.4%. Our EBITDA for Quarter 4 is at Rs.\\n48.82 crores as against Rs. 34.2 crores, up by 42.71%.\\nOur PAT for Quarter 4 is at Rs. 27.81 crores as against Rs. 17.47 crores in corresponding quarter\\nof last year, up by 59.2%. These numbers are primarily driven by the performance of electric\\nbus segment where the volumes have grown by 24%. We have done about 158 electric vehicles,\\nwhich includes 17 E-tippers in Quarter 4 as against 127 electric buses delivered in corresponding\\nQuarter 4 of last year.\\nWe are pleased to inform our shareholders that during Quarter 4, we have added 3 more new\\ncustomers to the portfolio. The new customers are KSRTC, which is India's largest STU,\\nMSRTC and Thane Municipal Corporation and by delivering intercity and city electric buses.\\nIn the current quarter, MEIL has donated about 10 Olectra buses for TTD replacing the existing\\ndiesel buses for pilgrim’s transport in Tirumala Hills. We also had a positive contribution from\\ninsulator segment in Quarter 4, due to significant improvement in operating margins, primarily\\ndriven by the export business.\\nComing to the full year performance:\\nThe Company has been surpassing the record year-on-year with new highs achieved in financial\\nyear ’22, ’23 in terms of both top line and bottom-line growth. We have crossed a milestone of\\nRs. 1000 crore plus revenue. The revenue growth is primarily driven by the electric vehicle\\nsegment, which has grown by 94% from Rs. 585.43 crores to Rs. 1,134.41 crores for the full\\nyear. The EBITDA stood at Rs. 148.63 crores as against Rs. 86.19 crores, up by 72.4% with\\nhealthy EBITDA margin of 13%. The PAT for the Company stood at Rs. 70.7 crores versus Rs.\\n35.7 crores, up by 98%.\\nThe operating margins have been very good both in insulators segment and electric bus segment.\\nThe net profit, as I mentioned, has grown by 98%. On the tax line, the tax rate is 22% in the\\ncurrent year versus 31% in the last year.\\nA word on the consolidated results:\\nThe Company again achieved excellent growth in Quarter 4 and 12 months.

We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question is\\nfrom the line of Nishid Shah from Ambika Fincap. Please go ahead.\\n\\nNishid Shah:\\n\\nThanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good set of numbers. My question is on\\nthe details of the expansion that is the by when do we expect to have the capacity of 5,000 buses?\\nAnd my second question is on the car. Since we have a tie-up with BYD on the buses and I think\\nthe BYD cars are being imported, CKD into India and they are being sold by the Landmark\\nshowrooms, but are we going to participate and partner with BYD in terms of manufacturing\\ncars in India? These are the two questions right now.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nRegarding your first question on the expansion, right, we are very much committed to establish\\nthe Greenfield facility and the documentation process is completed. We are looking for the best\\nopportunity to raise the funds and exploring various options. We have floated tenders for\\nestablishing the facility and soon we will appoint the vendor for construction of the plant. We\\nare expecting to shift to the new facility in Quarter 4 of the current financial year.\\nAnd coming to the second question on the cars. As of now, Company is focused on the existing\\nbusiness of electric buses. And we have entered into the new product portfolio of electric tippers\\nand we are focusing on introducing new models, new product line in electric tippers as well as\\nbuses.\\n\\nNishid Shah:\\n\\nSo, on the fundraising, are we having any plan, or we don't need the funds because I was told\\nthat the parent, Megha Infrastructure, may pump in money and you may not need to do\\nfundraising exercises?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nThere is no change in plans for fundraising. We have an enabling resolution. The market\\nconditions were not conducive and once the market condition improves, we are all set to go\\nahead with the fund-raising plans and we are exploring various options. We'll keep the investors\\nupdated on any progress on this matter.\\n\\nNishid Shah:\\n\\nThank you, for taking my questions. I'll come back in the queue.\\n\\nPage 4 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",

Please go ahead.\\n\\nSiddhartha Bera:\\n\\nSir, first question is on the volume side. So, can you just share how much will be the order book\\nwe have now for the electric buses for the next year? And any numbers you plan to produce to\\ncater to this demand?\\n\\nSiddhartha Bera:\\n\\nSo, I was asking about your plan to what will be your production target for the next year in FY\\n‘24 and ‘25.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nRegarding the order book, first question, we have order book of 3394 buses on hand as on 31st\\nMarch 2023, after delivering 563 electric buses. And as well as the plans for the next year, we\\nare targeting a growth of about 2.5 to 3x to the current number, approximately about 1,200 to\\n2,500 electric buses/tippers.\\n\\nSiddhartha Bera:\\n\\nOn the tipper side, sir, we have already delivered a few in the last month. How do you look at\\nthe ramp up? I mean, earlier you targeted about doing 200 units per month in some time. So,\\nhow do you see the ramp up going ahead of the electric tipper set?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nCurrently, we have an order for 20 tippers. Against that, we have delivered about 17 tippers. We\\nare expecting very good response. Our trials have been very, very successful. And as I told you,\\nthe overall volume we are expecting including tippers could be in the region of 1,200 to 1,500\\nthis year. And we are expecting some orders very soon.\\n\\nSiddhartha Bera:\\n\\nAnd this quarter, we would have delivered how many electric buses and tippers in Q4?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nIn Q4, we delivered 141 electric buses and 17 electric tippers.\\n\\nSiddhartha Bera:\\n\\nSecond question is, sir, are on the balance sheet side. So, if I look at our inventory days or say\\nthe receivable days, it still remains quite high, I mean we have doubled this year versus last year.\\nBut if I look at the inventory receivable days, they still are pretty high like about 230 days as per\\nmy calculation and even the inventory days have also gone up from 47 to 50 days. So, do you\\nthink I mean, these levels will continue as we scale up or should we expect some normalization\\nhow to think about this and why it is on the higher side.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, basically, the average receivables period has come down compared to quarter 3 ending. The\\noverall net working days is about 99. It is reduced and the collection period we are expecting the\\ncollection period to be about 3 to 3.5 months. And this is going to get corrected in next 2 to 3\\nquarters. And as far as inventory is concerned, we have currently only 2 months of stock. As we\\nramp up the production, we are likely to increase the inventory days.\\n\\nSiddhartha Bera:\\n\\nSo, you're saying a collection period of 3 to 3.5 months will continue even as we scale up to say,\\n1,500 or 2,000 in the next few years?\\n\\nPage 5 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs of now, yes. Maybe in 2 or 3 quarters, we are likely to see some improvement. But overall,\\nour networking days is expected to be around 3 to 3.5 months.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Rakesh Jain from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nSir, my first question is regarding, how are you seeing the orders flows and trends playing out\\nin the bus segment? There's some bit of concerns around, what the FAME subsidy is going to\\nlook like over the next few years, right? And for some segments, there's even talk of cutting on\\nthe subsidy. And have you seen any sort of concerns of where government is asking for\\nadditional clarity on the parts you are supplying or the component or the localization you are\\ndoing right now. And how are you seeing next 1 year from the government there because we\\nread that some of the articles saying that the bidders are not willing to bid at for some of the\\norders recently by CESL due to the pricing difference and the compliance issues. So, what are\\nyou seeing on ground? I mean, exactly what's happening?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs far as the orders in pipeline is concerned, about almost 10,000 buses are in various stages of\\ntendering. One of the biggest order is MSRTC, 5,150 buses where we have submitted our bids.\\nAnd as far as the FAME subsidy is concerned, I think we have spoken earlier, the new tenders\\nor bids are going to be without subsidies, that is the intention of the government because the\\nFAME subsidy is going to end by 2024. So, where the FAME-II subsidy was earmarked for\\nabout 7,090 electric buses. So, once that is completed, the FAME-II subsidy program will be\\ncompleted, and all the new tenders will be without any FAME subsidy.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nSo, how does it change the pricing on overall basis when you apply for bids now, given that\\nsubsidy will no more be applicable? And do you see that impacting volumes to an extent?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, currently, the average cost per kilometer for any STU pan India is about almost Rs. 150 per\\nkilometer. With FAME subsidy, the average cost, let us say, is Rs. 50. There is a huge differential\\nbetween the average CPK currently versus the electric bus. Now, when the subsidy component\\nis no longer there, the cost is likely to go up. But even if you assume that from Rs. 50, it goes up\\nto Rs. 100, still there's a huge gap between the average cost per kilometer of an STU versus the\\nelectric bus. So, it is highly remunerative for the STUs to continue to go for electric buses.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nSo, I mean, given that the pricing is going to go up and even where the funding will be largely\\nnow if it comes, it has to come from the state side and the central will largely not provide any\\nmore support when these orders are being laid out. Is that correct understanding?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, basically, some of the states like for example, state of Maharashtra has been very\\nprogressive in terms of bringing their own state subsidies like for example from the Pune Smart\\nCity Corpus.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for patiently waiting, we have the management line\\nreconnected.

Please go ahead.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nI just had the follow up on this FAME thing. You mentioned that incrementally most tenders\\nwould come without the FAME subsidy being factored. Have you seen any change in terms of\\nthe way now the bidding is happening given that incentive is not available? So, how should we\\nthink about the bidding or the pricing scenario as subsides sort of go away? Also on the subsidies,\\nI mean, whatever government has so far funded, what are the conditions like I mean, is it\\nlocalization? Is there anything else that they are enforcing to be able to get that incentives?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAnswering your first question, the CESL new tenders, the rates have increased compared to the\\nfirst tender which was floated in the beginning by CESL, and the participation has been quite\\ngood, and we are expecting the bid rates to definitely go up by Rs. 15, Rs. 20 against FAME,\\nright, in the new tenders. And as far as the subsidy is concerned, yes, as per the FAME\\nregulations, one of the key requirement is complying with the localization norms. And subject\\nto the localization norms, the other requirement is providing bank guarantee for releasing the\\nsubsidy.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nOn this pricing which you mentioned that it is the new CESL bids. If I recall correctly, the last\\none was somewhere around 50. I'm not sure. Maybe if you can just give an idea of what it was\\nin these initial contract and now, where it is?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, initial contract, as actually though it was won by a competitor, till date, nothing has\\nprogressed on this contract. It was at very, very low at about Rs. 43 to Rs. 45 rupees per\\nkilometer, right? Against that, the new contracts are significantly better off. It's about 60 plus.\\nAnd the other aspect is the adoption is really picking up of electric buses and like the ecosystem\\nis getting created. So, without subsidy also it is remunerative for the STU’s to go for electric\\nbuses. And for other new contracts, the competitor has not bid for the new contracts. That’s for\\nyour kind information.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nSo, who are the participants in the new CESL, I mean, who won?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nThe new CESL contracts are basically now it is coming up, actually recent program got deferred.\\nJust to give a clarity, again, I think first bid was won by Tata Motors. And later it got distributed\\nbetween 2 parties. The second CESL was bid by 4 different companies and it is split between 4\\ncompanies.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nAnd the rates are higher, okay. The other question that of course, the demand as you mentioned\\nhas been very, very strong, and there's clearly a big government push on E-bus adoption. But\\noften supply chain is the biggest issue that most companies talk of. So, where are we on supply\\nchain now, in terms of the battery tie-ups, motors, whatever be the ecosystem, I mean, how is\\n\\nPage 7 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  \"Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nthat progressing? And the financing is also something which has been a constraint. So, if you\\ncan just share some thoughts on how is the ecosystem developing around these 2 things?\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, supply chain concerns, as you rightly said, has been one of the issues in the industry. So,\\nbasically, as you're aware, all the OEMs have to depend on imports for battery cells and some\\nof the powertrain components. So, other than that, most of the components are localized in India.\\nSo far as the supply chain constraints, we are in a better position now compared to quarter 2 and\\nquarter 3. And what was the second part of the question?\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nFinancing?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nFinancing, as you rightly said, in the initial years, it was very, very difficult for the lenders to\\ncome in. Now because of the model concessioner agreement and because of the process, which\\nare favorable to the lenders, a lot of lenders have come forward and financing the electric vehicle\\nsegment. And, in our own case, we have sanctions by about 4 to 5 finance institutions, which\\nincludes State Bank of India, Yes Bank, Karnataka Bank, Bank of India, REC. These are the\\nmajor lenders which are financing the operating Company which is an associate Company. As\\nyou're aware, the business model which is prevalent is the GCC model, wherein Olectra is the\\nOEM. We manufacture and sell the buses and take care of the after-sale service.\\n\\nGunjan Prithyani:\\n\\nJust last question from my side. Are you seeing any activity pick up on the private side like\\nschools and, other corporates on the E-buses?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes, it is the picking up. Actually, the traction is yet to happen, but definitely it is picking up.\\nBecause of their balance sheet size is low, they were not financial sanctions, it was delaying, but\\nfor your kind information, we got first private order and we are delivering buses for intercity\\noperations. And this player is known as Fresh Bus and we have an order of about 19 buses from\\nthem, and they're going to operate between Bangalore and Tirupati.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Divya Daga from Vijit Global Securities Private Limited.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nRohit Bahirwani:\\n\\nRohit Bahirwani this side from Vijit Global Securities.

I've been following your Company\\nfor the last 5 years and performance has been improving quarter-on-quarter. Sir, a couple of\\nquestions. Firstly, what is the difference in margin profile of your buses and your tippers? So,\\nyou want to take one by one?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, basically, we would like to specify our margin guidelines though we have earned good\\nEBITDA margins about 13% overall in terms of very high volumes it would be in the range of\\n10%-12%. See, tippers will be slightly better because this is going to be non-STU business.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nHow much will it be?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nDefinitely, I would not like to reveal on the margin difference, definitely it is better than the\\nbuses.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nSo, when we see segment results, so we see just 17 buses and around Rs. 2.5 crores PBIT. So,\\nthat is leading into this question. Sir, no problem, we will wait for more sales to happen. So,\\nright now, when we talk of 1200 buses plus tippers, so what are we expecting in June quarter?\\nHow many tippers to be delivered since we’re almost mid of May? And I don’t think your\\nbusiness is skewed towards the end of the quarter, it's a normalized business. So, what kind of\\ndelivery are you talking about in June quarter?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSo, as of now, I think we will not be able to give the exact number because we are expecting the\\norder very shortly. But overall, I think we are expecting to do about 200 numbers.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\n200 in Q1?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes. 200 both buses and tippers together.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nAnd sir, which was this Company you said where you got the first private order going to run\\nbetween Bangalore and Tirupati?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nIt is Fresh Bus.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nFresh, F-R-E-S-H B-U-S?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nF-R-E-S-H, yes.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nFresh Bus, so it’s a private Company, okay, fine.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nIt's a private Company, yes.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nSo, it's not on the FAME-II subsidy?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nIt is not on FAME-II, it is the intercity operation. It is totally non-FAME.\\n\\nPage 9 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c\",\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nSo, do you disclose what kind of rates are there?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWhat exactly is you are looking at? Selling price?\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nNo, you are going to run for them or you are selling it to them?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nNo, see basically, they are buying outright and some of the buses are again, it will on a hiring\\nbasis. As far as Olectra is concerned, we are making outright sale.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nOkay. EV trans and all those things are not involved in this. Okay. And what will be the ASP of\\nthese buses, average selling price of these buses and the margin profile, sir?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSo, as of now, it’s a very new order. We will not be able to reveal the pricing, but definitely it is\\nwith a decent margin.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nI have full faith in you that you will be doing the best margin possible since it’s a non-fame\\nthing. Sir, tell me one thing. When you mentioned about the new CESL tender, so we had heard\\nin the third tender nobody participated. I am just talking about newspaper article, I don’t know\\nwhether it is true or not. So, what, CESL is going to reframe the tender for the pricing or what?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think, one of the tender where nobody has participated is a dry lease. See, currently the model\\nis wet lease, so dry lease means the drivers of the StU will be involved, which all the OEMs are\\nnot keen.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nYes, obviously. Okay, fine. Obviously, you won’t be interested if their drivers are there because\\nthen you will have to pay them as per their standard.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nThey will not be under our control, right? So, it’s very important,\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nSo, are they going to rework it?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSiddharth Agarwal:\\n\\nAnd sir, I had heard there was all these utilities, STUs and all, so they create problems in terms\\nof repayment. This is the industry sources. So, I just wanted to understand, do you people also\\nface problems of payment? And how is your payment guaranteed by the STU because collection\\nof ticket is done by them at their ends? So, how do you ensure that your payment is on time?\\nAnd like 90 days I think are your debtors, so these will be the main debtors, right?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nJust to clarify, see, as far as Olectra is concerned, we manufacture and sell buses to the operating\\nCompany which owns the fleet. The Company, which is the concessioner, owns the fleet and\\nthey operate on a per kilometre with the STU. As far as Olectra is concerned, we sell the buses\\nand we take care of the services for the period of 10-12 years. All the new contracts are for 12\\nyears duration. But to give a perspective, Olectra is not directly involved. The operating\\n\\nPage 10 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nCompany in our case is EV Trans Private Limited. They are able to receive 70% to 80% of the\\nreceivables within 30 to 45 days. The balance, 25% to 30%, they are able to collect before 90\\ndays. The reason is basically the STUs are procuring services rather than CAPEX, right? And\\nunder this model concessioner agreement which is formulated by Niti Aagyog, there is escrow\\nmechanism where the revenues of these collections are pooled into that account. And 2 months\\nfees minimum deposit they should maintain.\\nModerator:\\n\\nWe will move to the next question that is from the line of Nishid Shah from Ambika Fincap.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nNishid Shah:\\n\\nThanks for taking my follow-up question. On the 3-wheelers, what is our strategy and from\\nwhere we are sourcing the batteries for that? And do we source it in India or we are sourcing it\\nfrom any other place?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nGentlemen, actually, we are still not into 3 wheelers. As of now, our focus is on electric buses\\nand electric tippers and trucks.\\n\\nNishid Shah:\\n\\nBut I think in one of the calls, Mr. Pradeep had said that we will be entering the 3 wheelers also.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI’ll just clarify. The CESL, when they floated the FAME-II program, they have actually\\nearmarked some budget for about 1 lakh 3 wheelers. So, through a partner, we had participated\\nand we got about 13,500 3 wheelers order. But the entire 3-wheeler segment is on hold by CESL.\\nSo, we are also not very keen to pursue.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Rakesh Jain from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nSir, you mentioned that about 17 tippers you had delivered in Q4, and based on your revenue, I\\nthink the ASP which you are quoting is roughly around Rs. 1.4 crore per tipper. Is that correct?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nThis is a significantly high ASP versus a conventional tipper in the market. So, what are the cost\\nelements differently playing out? And are these prices, that is ASP come down later in as you\\nramp up this production and how it will work?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nThis is nascent. As you rightly said, the industry is nascent. Definitely, we expect the prices to\\ncome down. The main factor will be battery, right? So, for the entire electric segment, we expect\\nthe battery prices to come down in next 2-3 years, okay? And the economics is actually quite\\nsignificant with excellent price differential which is there between electric tipper and the\\nconventional diesel tipper. So, because of that reason, there will be huge demand from the\\nmarket.\\n\\nPage 11 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nRight now, you don’t have any competitors. But I think there are few players who are willing to\\nlook at this market and are planning to launch over the next few quarters. So, do you think your\\ncurrent pricing is competitive?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSo, basically, we should look it in different way. As of now, we are the first Company to have\\nintroduced and basically registered and sold electric tippers. No major competitors as of now.\\nBut definitely there is a huge market in India for tipper and trucks which has a huge potential\\nfor everyone to come in. Even if you take all the capacities, the capacities are not sufficient to\\ncater to the requirement which can come up, right? So, we expect the competition to pick up in\\nthe next 1 to 2 years and it will be healthy for the ecosystem to get created.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nAnd what is your localization levels for tipper right now?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs of now, I think except the battery cells and the powertrain components, all other things are\\nlocalized.\\n\\nRakesh Jain:\\n\\nAnd these tippers which you are delivering, for what purpose it is going right now?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs of now, it’s basically used in mines, the project sites.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Naman Khandelwal from HDFC Bank. Please go ahead.\\n\\nNaman Khandelwal:\\n\\nSir, 2 questions on the STUs. Sir, the STUs are in losses. It was being discussed that on the SECI\\nside, structure would be established to have a payment security, central government agency\\nwhich would be ensuring that the payments have been released from the STUs on time. So, any\\ninsight on that? And second would be since the STUs are deploying EVs, is it safe to assume\\nthat these STUs will now be profitable because the majority of the STUs are in losses. Again,\\nthis is a state transport undertaking, so the load factor and everything, if it comes into the picture,\\nthen the revenue is not offsetting the pay-out which has been given to the operator. So, any\\ninsight on those?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, as far as the payment mechanism is concerned, escrow mechanism is in place and 2 months\\nfee is required to be deposited in the escrow account. And I think to earlier question raised by\\none of the participant, we had clarified that the concessioner is able to realize the receivables of\\nmore than 70% in less than 45 days and balance 25% to 30% in less than 90 days, right? So, that\\nis far as the first question is concerned. The second question is concerned with regard to?\\n\\nNaman Khandelwal:\\n\\nProfitability of the STUs.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, basically, there is 5x differential between conventional al diesel versus electric in terms of\\noperational costs, okay. So, that is 1 major incentive. Second is the EPK of the electric buses is\\nhigher than the diesel buses and this is giving good comfort for the STUs to adopt. And the most\\nimportant is now the STUs are assuming the role of controlling. So, because the entire operation\\n\\nPage 12 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nis taken care by the concessioner except the fare collection. And they are procuring services\\nrather than the CAPEX. I hope I have clarified.\\nNaman Khandelwal:\\n\\nYes. But again, so for this segment to be profitable, the STUs should have a revenue collection\\nfrom the end customer. So, we envisage that the cost which would be incurred although the\\noperational cost should be less of EV bus as compared to CNG or a diesel bus. But corresponding\\nrevenue from the customer will the STUs get to ensure that they turn profitable?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes. That’s what I was mentioning, it is highly remunerative for them because there is a huge\\ncost differential.\\n\\nNaman Khandelwal:\\n\\nAnd sir, any plans to get into battery cell or pack manufacturing.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nAs of now, we have no plans for any battery manufacturing. We have plans in the new facility\\nfor assembly of battery cells to a pack.\\n\\nNaman Khandelwal:\\n\\nAnd the last question from my side. When is the order book expected to be delivered for 3394\\nbuses? Where is the delivery schedule?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, we have time of 12-18 months to deliver the buses.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nThe next question is from the line of Anil, as an individual investor. Please go ahead.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nCan you please update what’s the status of fund raising?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nI think one of the questions was asked on this, but let me clarify again. There is no change in the\\nplans for fundraising. We have enabling resolution. The market conditions were not conducive\\nand once the market condition improves, we are all set to go ahead with the fundraising plan.\\nAnd we are actually exploring various options. We will keep you posted once there is any\\nprogress on this matter.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nDo you think that it will affect execution of setting up of our factories for which you have\\nrecently raised the tender?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSo, basically, we are expecting a delay of 2 to 3 months.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nLast time, when I asked the question, like I was told that by January ’24, we’ll start the\\nproduction. And if you see the tender, it is already delayed by 6 months. But if you say the\\nmarket conditions are not conducive, is that going to further delay? Now we are expecting June\\n’24. Do you mean to say that it is going to go to January ’25?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nNo, we are expecting a delay of about 3 months. So, in Quarter 4, definitely, we are striving to\\nget the plant operational by Quarter 4 of this year.\\n\\nPage 13 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nAnil:\\n\\nAnd recently we got a good news saying that Amara Raja Batteries, they are starting to\\nmanufacture the lithium-ion batteries. Is that going to help our Company?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nDefinitely, we are looking forward. As long as the costs are coming down, obviously, we will\\nbe looking at the option. But we have definitely minimum 2-3 years’ time.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nAnd we just heard that in Rajasthan also we could find like good reserves of lithium. Do you\\nthink that these kind of development encourages us to go for the in house manufacturing of\\nbatteries.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nDefinitely, yes. See, the PLI scheme which has been given by the government and I think few\\ncompanies have got this PLI scheme and as far as the lithium reserves,it is going to take a lot of\\ntime for them to actually get the exact quantity which is available but it is very encouraging for\\nthe country and the EV segment.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nAnd can we say that by June ’24, the factory will be in place and sales will start happening from\\nJune ’24.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nDefinitely yes. We are striving to meet that.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nDo you have any plans for fund raising.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, we are hoping that the things would improve with regard to the market. And so once that is\\nin place we are ready for the fund raise.\\n\\nAnil:\\n\\nIt’s just a surprise like you come from such a good background of a sound promoter, I am not\\nsure like why we have to wait for external conducive environment for Rs. 400 crores or Rs. 800\\ncrores of fund raising. That’s a very much good amount which can be invested as well by\\npromoters and take the Company to a new set scale of valuation and then invite the outside\\ninvestors of valuation. Why now? This Rs. 800 crores, easily you can create 10 times of valuation\\nnow because the industry is nascent and growing and you should take an advantage of investing\\nyour own money and show the people and show the world that you are capable of taking the\\nCompany to such a stage where you can deliver up to 5,000 buses in a year. And then after that,\\nwhy don’t you look for external investment?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, you have to best understand that we are looking for good investors to come into the system\\nand once they come in, they would definitely look at profitability. And they are almost ready\\nwith the fund raise program. Unfortunately, the market has not been conducive for the last 3\\nmonths. So, now that things are slowly stabilizing, and think if you have seen, I think they’ve\\ngot some IPO which got concluded from Mankind. Things are happening positively and we\\nexpect the market to improve and definitely would like to do fund raise and followed by\\ndefinitely promoters also would like to contribute.\\n\\nPage 14 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

And because it makes sense\\nfor us to invest now and make sure that our valuation from Rs. 5,000 crores it goes to Rs. 25,000\\ncrores. And at that point of time, you get the outside investors.

The matter is likely to come up in this month.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nSo, how many buses have been delivered so far of that order till date?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe have delivered about 20 buses out of 2,100 buses.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nSo, you mentioned you have an order book of 3,000 odd buses. Does it include the Mumbai\\norder?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes, correct.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nSir, don’t you think it will be prudent to leave that order out of your order book at this point\\nbecause it’s been sub-judice and you don’t want to talk about it and it’s out of your control.

              "  'Olectra Greentech Limited\\nMay 9, 2023\\nAnyways, sir, I wanted to know, and please correct me if I am wrong, you mentioned that you\\nplan on delivering about 1500 buses odd this financial year. Is that correct? Did I hear that\\ncorrectly?\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nAnd then you mentioned that you will probably be doing 200 this quarter in Q1. Basically, I just\\nwant to understand the math of how you come up with 1500 numbers because there are 2\\nfunctionalities to it in my mind. Last year you had supply chain issues which you mentioned to\\none of your participant that it’s sort of easing off, but they still exist. Two, you have your capacity\\nwhich has been postponed because of your fund-raising postponement, you expect to happen in\\nQ4. So, if today you are doing about 150 buses a quarter, you are saying you are going to do 125\\nodd buses plus tippers every month. But then you are saying you are doing 200 buses this quarter.\\nI mean the math doesn’t add up. What is the plan internally if you can sort of help us understand.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, basically, our focus this year would like to complete the order book other than the BEST\\nwhich is under sub-judice, okay. And we are very conservative in giving those numbers of 1,200\\nto 1,500 numbers. See, we have faced, definitely not only us, the entire industry faced this supply\\nchain constraint. So, those things are fine now. We would like to be very conservative in\\nprojecting our numbers. We have a capacity of making 125 buses per month.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nAnd I am assuming this capacity is fungible with the tipper, right? Your tipper and the buses get\\nmade in the same facility?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nSo, what you are saying is you are going to operate at 100% capacity utilization for the next\\nentire year which is 125 buses a month which adds up to 1500 buses a year. But in Q1 you will\\ndeliver 200 buses, means then you will basically have to operate at more than 100% in the next\\n9 months.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, basically, we are operating on a single shift. We can definitely increase our capacity. So,\\nour plan is to do about 1,200 to 1,500 buses/tippers this year.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nI’m sorry. I am not being able to understand the math. I understand your plan but it is just not\\nadding up. Question #3 is you mentioned that you sold 17 tippers in the last quarter. Now, I don’t\\nknow if you can sort of give details but was this sold to the parent Company or was it an outside\\ncustomer?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nNo, it is sold to MEIL, we got a bus order from MEIL for 20 electric tippers.\\n\\nPage 16 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

So, your\\npayment comes in as soon as you send, like you sell a car, you sell a truck, right?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nCorrect.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nSo, how does the payment structure work? In how many days do you get payment from MEIL\\nfor a sale of a tipper to them?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe get an advance and then we settle it 50% we receive.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nSir, you mentioned 50%, right?\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nYes. 50% advance and 50% within 60 to 90 days.\\n\\nPunit Chokhani:\\n\\nAnd sir, you have an order book at this point from MEIL specifically which you can share for\\nthe tippers.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nWe have received first order book of 20 tippers from MEIL, and we have delivered 17. We are\\ngetting lot of inquiries from many players, many parties. So, it’s in an inquiry stage to get\\ntranslated into a proper order.

But\\nyou’ve got a large competitor down south. Murugappa Group has done an acquisition for a\\nCompany which does tippers and trucks from Haryana. What is your 2 senses on that? Because\\nthey already have fleet on the street like what we hear is they deliver buses, they deliver trucks\\nto Dalmia Cement and that category of clients already. So, what is your sort of 2 senses on that\\nwould sort of help us understand better.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nSee, I think I’ve clarified in earlier questions. So, basically there is lot of opportunities for\\neveryone to come in. As far as we are concerned, our tippers have done successful trials and the\\nperformance has been very, very encouraging. And the tipper truck market is quite huge. And\\nthe economics is quite good between diesel tipper and electric tipper. And I think we had been\\ndoing extensive trials for more than a year. And successfully did all kind of terrain. And as the\\nmarket is quite huge, even if anybody comes in, I think the ecosystem will be created and will\\nhelp the market.\\n\\nModerator:\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to\\nthe management for closing comments.\\n\\nSharat Chandra:\\n\\nThank you very much. I once again thank all the stakeholders who have been very supportive,\\nwho have been encouraging and who have been very patient with the Company and the faith\\nreposed in our Company. And thank you very much.\\n\\nPage 17 of 18\\n\\n\\x0c',\n",
